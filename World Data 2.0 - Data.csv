That responsibility lends special importance to our role in this organ and beyond.
We gather here each September, and 77 years since its establishment, the United Nations has only gained in its universal appeal, serving as the parliament of humankind, the forum where we speak to each other and listen to the world. Like nowhere else, the world converges here. We share our successes and progress, outline issues and challenges, express worries and fears, highlight crises and tensions, and talk about agreements and discords, but above all we bring a joint desire for a better world.
In these nearly eight decades, we have witnessed uninterrupted change, profound transformation, unprecedented mobilization, continued solidarity and an all-time imperative of the need to work together. As a result, the world has known undeniable progress on many tracks. On the other hand, we must never forget that our journey has been bumpy. Many times, we have also witnessed terrible setbacks and even reversals of progress. Unfortunately, this is mainly due to man-made catastrophes, ill-conceived policies based on narrow national politics and short-sighted interests fuelled by populism, nationalism and greed for domination.
That is why this place at this time each year is the yearly check-up of the health of the world. We may sometimes have the impression that we say too much of the same thing and that we needlessly and too often repeat each other. I disagree. If committing to peace and security, to development and prosperity, to upholding international law and respecting human rights or to engaging in genuine efforts to mitigate climate change is repeating each other, then we are doing the right thing.
Unfortunately, this year our hopes and beliefs have been bitterly shattered and our assurances broken by an unprovoked, unjustified and premeditated war of one country against another on the European continent — the brutal aggression of Russia against its neighbour, Ukraine. Russia’s war of choice is against Ukraine and its people; not only that, but it is also a brutal assault on international Law, a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and a very direct threat to the European security architecture. It is an open battle between an aging, cynical tyranny and a young, growing democracy. While we all, in our own way and with our respective means, try individually and collectively to project ourselves into the future, one country, led by an illusion of grandeur from bygone times, has decided to drag the world backwards and go against everything we have built over decades. This is unacceptable.
We will continue to stand in full solidarity with Ukraine and its people, and, like many other countries, help them in any way we can to defend themselves. Their fight is also ours, and I hope that all Members of the United Nations share the core principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, freedom and the right to independently decide on their own future, without fear or interference. Shying away from this defining battle between those principles and all their antitheses is shying away from the duty to protect ourselves, our countries and our children.
While the world expects Russia to come to reason, stop the war and engage in peace negotiations, just a few days ago the Kremlin made another choice, that of escalation, announcing a partial mobilization that would deepen the conflict and bring more crimes, more victims and more misery, but also more shame on Russia itself. Sham referendums are being conducted in some parts of the occupied Ukrainian under the threat of the gun.
It is hard to imagine that anyone here can silently accept such disgraceful disregard of laws, rules, norms and practices that govern relations among States in the twenty-first century. These actions run contrary to international law and not only do not reflect the free will of the Ukrainian people but also offer a miserable show of detachment from everything that brings us together under the roof of the United Nations. We condemn such actions engineered in Moscow and will not recognize any such lawlessness.
In the world we want, impunity should not be a shelter for those who must answer for their deeds. Albania is fully committed to accountability globally and to fighting impunity everywhere, not only to provide justice to victims but also to prevent future atrocities. That is why Albania calls for and supports work towards the adoption of a convention on the prevention and punishment of crimes against humanity. That new instrument would fill a significant gap in the current international framework and facilitate international cooperation to protect civilians.
The world is never a quiet place and there are many serious challenges that need to be properly and immediately addressed. We face serious challenges from open conflict in many parts of the world. Many countries are subject to intolerable seizure of power by force. Terrorism remains a serious threat to peace and security.
At a time when a multitude of crises have plunged the world into turmoil, including from unacceptable nuclear threats, I would like to call the attention of the Assembly to another crucial issue, closely linked and with a huge impact on peace and security: cybersecurity. Technology is nowadays part of every aspect of our lives. In Albania, 95 per cent of services to the citizens and business are offered online. These user-friendly systems save time and energy, drastically improve efficiency and quality, and are the best tool to eliminate endemic corruption.
Last July, however, Albania was the target of an unprovoked, large-scale cyberattack. The Government’s entire digital infrastructure was under sustained and coordinated assault, with the clear aim of destroying it, paralysing public services, stealing data and electronic communications from government systems, creating chaos and fomenting tension in the country. A lengthy and thorough in-depth investigation, conducted in cooperation with the best existing world expertise on cyberterrorism, has now confirmed beyond any doubt that the cyberattack that sought to bring a sovereign country to its knees was a State-sponsored aggression, orchestrated and carried out by the Islamic Republic of Iran.
This is why, in the face of a such blatant breach of the norms of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in peacetime, which include refraining from damaging critical infrastructure that provides services to the public, the Government of Albania was left with no other choice but to sever diplomatic relations with Iran. We hope that this forced extreme measure will be an example and a deterrent to anyone who supports or sponsors such abhorrent actions against sovereign States. We urge the United Nations, including the Security Council, to focus more seriously and concretely on addressing cybersecurity by investing in prevention and helping Member States build resilience.
Albania is a member of the Balkan community, a part of Europe that has had its share of very troubled history. One need only mention the word “Balkans” and, I would bet, images stained by bloody wars and brutal crimes will come to everyone’s mind. One would rightly recall the scars of repression and oppression, genocide in Srebrenica and brutal ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. None of that is or will be forgotten.
Accountability has and will continue to be called for, and we must redouble our efforts to guarantee its unhindered course. This requires a resolved commitment to the ideals of justice and, above all, to cooperation between parties. Justice lies in the foundations of any effort for long-lasting peace, stability and prosperity. But justice is served with facts, proof and evidence, not with fiction or distorted reality. I cannot but share here a terrible example of that, which should serve as a lesson to all the word and, first and foremost, the democratic world.
In 2011, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted a report, compiled by a zealous parliamentarian who goes by the name Dick Marty, accusing the Kosovo Liberation Army of the despicable crime of organ trafficking. Mr. Marty should have been paid as a storyteller, but never trusted as a rapporteur of the Council of Europe. His report was shocking, and not only did many believe it at the time, but it became the key factor in enhancing the idea of and establishing the Kosovo Specialist Chambers. It also became one of the worst cases of distorted reality, a kind of manifesto for worldwide propaganda against Kosovo’s independence.
Every investigative effort has been made during these 11 long years to prove those allegations nationally, regionally and internationally — to no avail. Nothing — not a single shred of evidence or proof — was found anywhere, in Kosovo or anywhere else, regarding the alleged trafficking of organs. Yet, the Kosovo Specialist Chambers, which were founded on the basis of that report, arrested Kosovo’s sitting President, Hashim Thagi, without indictment. He waited a year in detention until he was formally indicted. I would ask everyone here to imagine for a moment their president, prime minister or country leader being removed from office in a third country and kept there in custody for a whole year without any formal indictment by a body created and sponsored by a community of democratic countries. And guess what? Not a single word of the entire indictment that came next has anything to do with the Council of Europe’s report on the alleged crime of organ trafficking. It is a complete fantasy. Is this not a monumental failure of international politics? This is not about a person. It is not about a court procedure. This is about inflicting an undue stain on a country and its history.
Nevertheless, exactly because democracy and its institutions have, among many virtues, that of repairing their faults and errors, we strongly believe that, based on this crying lack of any evidence whatsoever, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe will honour the truth and accept Albania’s request to produce a follow-up report and, although the damage has been done, help restore the credibility of such an important international organization as the Council of Europe. We will never give up on this truth, and we will not stop honouring all of those who have given their lives for freedom and independence, and against whom nobody, in anybody’s name, can cast a single speck of dirt.
I will say a few more words on the Western Balkans, not of the past but of the future — the one that we are working to build together. You need only turn that region in any way you want, and you will find a lot of fuel for division and toxicity. But we in Albania have realized that the best way to advance is to do so together, with shared benefits as sovereign countries but close partners; as national players joined by a common enterprise, with our specific interests as part of a common framework that responds to our citizens.
This brought us, together with North Macedonia and Serbia, to launch the Open Balkans initiative, a platform open to all Balkan countries — not just the three of us but Montenegro and Kosovo, Bosnia and Tiirkiye, Greece and further — as an investment for everyone and part of the wider, common European project. The best message of the Open Balkans that I want to share today is that you do not need to agree on everything to leave a dark past behind and build step by step a common, bright future by dealing with your disagreements in an increasingly gracious way and by finding ever more good reasons to resolve those disagreements.
By strengthening its relations with Serbia and moving forward together to boost bilateral and regional cooperation, Albania has not and will not move an inch from its firm position in support of the need for every country represented here that has not yet done so, including first and foremost Serbia, to recognize the Republic of Kosovo. It is high time for Kosovo and Serbia to move beyond the current stalemate in their dialogue and to work bravely towards a comprehensive peace agreement by doing their respective parts to adopt a breakthrough document backed by the European Union and the United States.
Dialogue is not just a better way; it is the sole and unique way to deal with issues, however difficult they may appear, however complex they may be. I remain convinced that Open Balkans will only help facilitate this process, to the benefit of all: Albanians and Serbs, Kosovo and Serbia, but also for the entire region and the wider Europe.
Despite all the worries and challenges that keep us awake at night, we should not lose hope, we should keep trying and renew efforts in order to put universality at the heart of what we say and what we do at the national, regional and global levels. More than ever, in today’s shaken world, we need to commit ourselves to our fundamental universal values and acknowledge that we constitute a community of fate, despite our different national perspectives and interests.
Global warming will not distinguish between North and South, and the rise of the sea level will not stop at any shore. If the pandemic that shook the world to the core, has taught us anything, it is a very simple lesson, that no one is immune until everyone is. It is in that spirit that Albania acts in the region, in Europe, including here, at the General Assembly and in the Security Council, that the world expects rightfully to deliver, to stand up and save lives, to prevent and re-solve conflict not to be paralyzed or held hostage.
Let me conclude by quoting a beautiful African proverb, which says it all about our United Nations: “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”

Algeria,DZA,Africa,"  42,228,000 ",13328,10.12899971,5.0,76.693,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,1072,2.54,"  42,145,288 ",99.80,7.09,"At the outset, I am pleased to extend to Mr. Csaba Korosi my warmest congratulations on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its current session, and to wish him every success in performing his tasks. I also thank Mr. Abdulla Shahid for his distinguished presidency of the seventy-sixth session.
I also cannot but to reiterate to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres our full support for his efforts and endeavours aimed at improving the performance of our Organization and strengthening its role in accordance with the three pillars of the Charter of the United Nations, namely, security, development and human rights.
Our session is taking place as the world is witnessing escalating tensions that threaten to have serious repercussions on the system of international relations, especially in light of the resurgence of the phenomenon of polarization, as is the case with the Ukraine crisis and its negative repercussions, which will significantly exacerbate existential challenges in vital areas. That situation, with its complexities and dilemmas, which are difficult to anticipate in all their aspects in the current circumstances, highlights more than ever the structural imbalances that characterize global governance mechanisms and the urgent need to address them through an approach that ensures parity and equality among all countries and puts an end to the long-standing marginalization of developing countries.
The profound transformations we are witnessing today, despite the difficulties they entail, give us opportunities to correct the path we are on and to work to uphold the principles and purposes upon which our Organization was founded. We therefore fully agree with the theme of the current session and believe that we are truly at a watershed moment in advancing multilateral action in the face of common challenges that prove day after day that our collective security is closely linked to the stability and prosperity of all our peoples, without exception.
My country, which this year celebrates the sixtieth anniversary of the restoration of its national independence and while resolutely pursuing the process of building a new Algeria under the leadership of President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, stresses its commitment to those values and principles and its determination to make its contribution to maintaining international peace and security and achieving comprehensive, just and sustainable development.
In that spirit, Algeria is preparing to host an important summit of Arab countries on 1 and 2 November, and looks forward to making that event a milestone in the process of joint Arab action towards a more effective contribution by the Group of Arab States to addressing current regional and international challenges. In that context, and in preparation for that important event, Algeria is pursuing its efforts to strengthen national unity among our Palestinian brothers in the light of the initiative launched by the President of the Republic, Mr. Abdelmadjid Tebboune, in line with the efforts of many sisterly Arab countries in this regard.
From this rostrum, I reaffirm that addressing the Palestinian question remains key to restoring security and stability in the Middle East region by consecrating the right of the brotherly Palestinian people to establish their independent State on the borders of 4 June 1967, with Jerusalem as its capital, and ending the occupation of the Syrian Golan, in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative. In that regard, Algeria affirms its support for the request submitted by the State of Palestine for full membership of the United Nations, and looks forward to welcoming it soon as the 194th State Member of the United Nations.
With the same determination, Algeria reiterates once again its support for the right of the brotherly people of Western Sahara to end the occupation of their lands and to exercise their inalienable and imprescriptible right to self-determination and independence. We call on the United Nations to redouble its efforts, through the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Western Sahara, Mr. Staffan de Mistura, to help the two parties to the conflict — two States members of the African Union, namely, the Kingdom of Morocco and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic — to resume the course of direct negotiations with a view to reaching a political solution acceptable to both parties within the framework of international legitimacy.
Proceeding from its principled positions and adherence to the principles of non-alignment and by virtue of its rich history and experience in the field of international mediation, Algeria stresses the need for the international community to go beyond the logic of crisis management and focus instead on the search for solutions. Whether the issue is related to cross-border threats or local conflicts, Algeria believes that the only way to sustainably break the vicious cycle of such crises is by addressing their root causes.
In that context, and in view of its leadership of the international mediation process and chairmanship of the Monitoring Committee on the implementation of the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in the Republic of Mali, emanating from the Algiers process, my country calls on the international community to support the Malian parties with a view to accelerating the implementation of all their commitments in light of the current delicate transitional phase in that brotherly country.
On neighbouring Libya, we stress once again the need to address the core of the crisis by ending foreign interference in all its forms in the affairs of that brotherly country, and to accompany the Libyan parties towards formulating the necessary agreements to move towards achieving the goals of national reconciliation and organizing free and fair elections that respond to the aspirations of the brotherly Libyan people to build their democratic and modern State.
At the regional level, the Sahel-Sahara region remains vulnerable to the challenges posed by the spread of terrorist threats and cross-border crimes against the background of the expansion of institutional instability, the exacerbation of development problems and the effects of climate change. Faced with those crisis situations, and by virtue of its responsibilities as the African Union coordinator for efforts to combat terrorism and violent extremism, as well as its policy of good-neighbourliness and solidarity, Algeria intends to intensify its efforts, in coordination with the concerned countries, to establish a new dynamic for the mechanisms of joint regional action so as to ensure joint and effective responses commensurate with the challenges posed by the threat of terrorism to all the peoples of the region.
Algeria is also working with its brothers from neighbouring countries to promote economic integration and sustainable development with a view to achieving shared prosperity that will enable the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals and strengthen peace and security in the region.
In that regard, I stress that Algeria, which is proud of its African affiliation, remains an active party in
the project of integration, prosperity and political and economic independence of the African continent. That can be achieved by eliminating the consequences of external interventions and moving to develop African solutions to African problems. We therefore call on the international community to accompany the positive dynamic of the African continent by meeting its commitments and supporting the African Union Agenda 2063, which reflects a common vision for the future of the continent, while encouraging the establishment of balanced partnerships that respect the sovereign decisions taken by the countries of the African continent within the framework of the African Union.
We also firmly believe that recent developments have proven beyond any doubt that our African continent, the cradle of humankind and in no way resembling the stereotyped image promoted about it, is capable of presenting a new model of human civilization that places human beings and their environment at centre stage and paves the way for establishing friendly relations among States on the basis of justice and equality.
In the midst of these developments and aware of the magnitude of the unprecedented challenges at the international and regional levels, Algeria has submitted its candidacy for non-permanent membership of the Security Council for the period 2024-2025. Its candidacy has been endorsed by the African Union, the League of Arab States and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.
Algeria, which looks forward to enjoying the support of Member States in the elections scheduled for June next year, is committed to upholding the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and will work with the other members of the Council to give greater effectiveness to international efforts to prevent the outbreak of conflicts and resolve them through peaceful means. We will also support the role of active regional organizations, encourage the prominent participation of women and young people in resolving crises and ensure the necessary protection for all vulnerable groups.
Undoubtedly, the international community is today at a critical juncture and required to take bold decisions to preserve its collective security and explore prospects for a promising future for all humankind. From that perspective, Algeria recognizes the need to avoid the mistakes of the past and their consequences and calls for the consolidation of all our efforts to ensure the success of the reform path, leading to the establishment of a global system of equity, equality in sovereignty, mutual interests and constructive cooperation.
We need, now more than ever, to work together and be guided by the principle of our common destiny so as to avoid dangerous mistakes that threaten the return of the darkest chapters of contemporary human history."
Argentina,ARG,South America,"  44,361,000 ",18695,8.517999649,5.8,76.52,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Lower Respiratory Infection,3747,8.45,"  44,361,000 ",100.00,8.41,"Many times in history, assassinations have been the prologue to great tragedies. Based on the rejection or hatred of their victims, the perpetrators of such actions have upended the public order and opened the gates to enormous social discord. Entire peoples have succumbed to such prophets of hate. For that very reason and in order to underscore the values of rational democratic coexistence, I would like to begin by expressing my gratitude for the solidarity that the entire world has shown with Argentina with regard to the attempt on the life of our Vice-President, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.
In Argentina, the attempt on the life of Vice-President not only affected the public order; it also sought to undermine the virtuous collective achievement that next year will see the celebration of its fortieth anniversary. In 1983, we restored democracy and began a long historic cycle during which different political parties have alternated serving in the Government.
We Argentinians adopted the “never again” agreement on State terrorism and political violence. We value democracy as a model of social development that demands respect for others in their diversity.
I am sure that fascist violence under the guise as republicanism will not succeed in changing the broad consensus to which the vast majority of Argentine society adheres. By exploiting the unrest caused by the pandemic and the economic effects of the war, extremist and violent narratives have proliferated and found fertile ground for promoting anti-political sentiment in our societies. Remaining silent before such glaring signs could make us responsible for jeopardizing the rule of law itself. Those who seek to weaken and erode democracies have a special interest in fostering extreme polarization. Let us not resign ourselves to such a scenario. Let us forge a robust global condemnation of those who promote division in our communities.
It is incumbent upon the General Assembly to respond to the warning signs on the planet in a timely manner. As survivors of a pandemic that struck humankind, we face the choice of learning from that tragic experience or watching the world move towards ever-greater confrontations. The pandemic revealed the enormous inequalities endured by the world’s population. Is it fair that the wealth of 10 men alone represents a sum greater than the combined income of 40 per cent of the world’s population? Where are the ethics in the fact that the pandemic has claimed four times as many lives in the poorest countries than in the richest? Failing to condemn this model of capital accumulation that concentrates wealth among a few people while millions of others drown in poverty makes us complicit in creating such a level of inequality. We still have time to stop many of the threats facing humankind. The injustices we are seeing will only get worse if extreme positions take root; if wars become protracted, while exacerbating hunger; and if persistent inflation erodes the incomes of the most vulnerable.
We must work together in solidarity. We must strengthen a cooperative multilateralism that will ensure the strengthening of the rule of law, the principle of non-violence and greater equity to reduce social gaps. In order to overcome such challenges, we must restore the primacy of peace. We have always advocated for the peaceful settlement of all disputes. It is imperative that all ongoing hostilities cease. For that reason, we need to work together to pursue dialogue and restore peace in the dispute that began with the Russian Federation’s military encroachment on the territory of Ukraine. As we seek to reach the horizon of global peacemaking, we must abandon the economic and financial practices that the developed world demands of the developing world. Maintaining the current situation will only increase poverty and marginalization. If we do not change, we will be unable to build fairer, freer and more stable societies committed to upholding their institutions.
Indebted nations suffer much more from the effects of the established system. Argentina is among them. For that reason, I would like to thank all the States that have supported us in the complex process of renegotiating our foreign debt. My Government did not create that debt but is addressing it in all seriousness. Our criteria are known. They respond to the provisions of resolution 69/319 of 2015, which stipulates that sovereign debt restructurings must promote sustained and inclusive growth while minimizing economic and social costs, warranting the stability of the international financial system and respecting human rights. While we call for a change in the paradigms that govern the international financial system, we subscribe to the same principles underpinning the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Food security must be guaranteed to all who live on the planet. Hunger cannot be allowed in this day and age. The recent reports of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations warn of the impact of the excessive volatility in some food prices and the changes in input markets that influence their production. All of that has had and continues to have a significant effect on increased inflation worldwide; all of those factors are to the detriment of the most vulnerable. Argentina will fulfil its role as a reliable producer and exporter of nutritious and quality food, as well as a supplier of technologies to improve food production. We must guarantee a fairer and more transparent, equitable and predictable international trade system for agricultural products. If we ensure such a system, food-producing countries will be able to make the needed investments to increase production and help alleviate world hunger
Just as we must ensure food security, we must have secure and predictable access to energy. Argentina will continue to stand ready to help overcome that great challenge. We are ramping up production to provide the world with clean energies ,and others that, like natural gas, will enable us to reduce carbon emissions during the transition. We have the world’s
second largest unconventional gas reserves and the fourth largest unconventional oil reserves. We hold large reserves of lithium and the potential to develop solar and wind energy, as well as low- and zero-emission hydrogen. We are working to ensure that our path towards achieving environmental sustainability and food and energy security will be feasible, but all our efforts will be in vain if we do not walk on that path within a framework of increased equitable economic and social development. In that spirit, we are deploying our industrial capabilities and creating added value along the entire production chain. We must include our industrial, scientific and technological suppliers at every turn. Production that creates dignified employment is the path we have chosen to develop.
Just as it is incumbent upon us to seek development that benefits everyone, the environmental situation of our planet urgently requires us to take firm and decisive action for the sake of future generations. Ecological problems require the involvement of everyone. They need a constructive relationship between States and societies — a crucial partnership, without which sustainable development becomes an illusion.
Urgent issues, such as climate change, biodiversity and plastic pollution, should mobilize our efforts in the hope that we can build a broad consensus to ensure the preservation of the planet and humankind. We are not all equally responsible for the climate crisis. Neither Latin America and the Caribbean nor Africa are at the forefront of carbon emissions. Responsibilities must clearly be differentiated, and that requires immediately alleviating the efforts of those that were not to blame.
We want to continue strengthening Argentina’s long-standing position based on the principles of international humanitarian law, unrestricted respect for the sovereignty of States, the self-determination of peoples, the gender perspective and cooperation.
Through the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, holding the presidency pro tempore, we are reinforcing the principles of collaboration, promoting democratic pluralism and fostering South- South and triangular cooperation.
Argentina is actively involved in peacekeeping operations, an essential instrument of the United Nations. We will continue on that path.
I would like to draw attention to the use of unilateral coercive measures. Under the Charter of the United Nations, the only legitimate sanctions are those imposed by the Security Council to enforce its resolutions regarding the maintenance of peace and security. Argentina therefore joins the demand by the peoples of Cuba and Venezuela that the blockades suffered by those nations be lifted.
I would like to thank all Member States for having entrusted Argentina with the presidency of the Human Rights Council this year. For us, the defence of human rights is part of our identity and our history. The Mothers and Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo taught us to persist and to fight. They showed us the way so that, with political will and social consensus, we could carry out a process to eradicate impunity that is unique in the world, based on memory, truth and justice.
In the same spirit, our country has expanded citizens’ rights by developing laws and public policies that promote the equality of women and diversity, based on an intersectoral, intercultural and human- rights approach.
The much-declared social equality requires that we all have access to the advantages offered by the present. In the digital era in which we live, we believe it a priority to universalize access to information and communication technologies and to promote actions that reduce the inequality gaps seen today.
The United Nations is the right place for the international community to achieve the necessary agreements to ensure the maintenance of a free, open, stable, secure and, above all, peaceful cyberspace, where hatred and violence are not fostered through anonymity.
Argentina condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It must be countered in the context of the rule of law and full respect for international law. We continue to fight against impunity, investigating the attacks on the Israeli Embassy in 1992 and on the headquarters of the Asociacion Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA) in 1994, which claimed the lives of 107 people and injured hundreds. We want those responsible for such heinous attacks to be identified, tried and ultimately sentenced. Once again, we urge the Islamic Republic of Iran to cooperate with the Argentine judicial authorities to advance the investigation into the AMIA bombing. We also urge the international community to join us in our struggle by refraining from receiving or harbouring any of the accused, even if they enjoy diplomatic immunity. We must remember that international arrest warrants and INTERPOL red notices are pending against them.
Latin America and the Caribbean is a region of peace. We are working to also make it more just and equal. We know the tremendous comparative advantage that the Southern Common Market, in particular, and all of Latin America, in general, have in sustainable food production and energy supply.
We have a great opportunity to develop. If we improve the quality of life of our people by creating genuine employment, we can eradicate the pockets of poverty that persist in our societies today.
I wish to reaffirm the legitimate and inalienable sovereign rights of the Argentine Republic over the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia, the South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas. They are part of Argentina’s national territory and have been illegally occupied by the United Kingdom for almost 190 years. The request made through resolution 2065 (XX), of 1965, has remained in force and has been reiterated on many occasions,
The United Kingdom persists in its attitude of disregarding the call to resume negotiations on the territorial dispute. Moreover, it has exacerbated the dispute by its calls for the illegal exploitation of renewable and non-renewable natural resources in the area. It also insists on an unjustified and excessive military presence on the islands, which only brings tension to a region characterized as an area of peace and international cooperation. We request that the Secretary-General renew his efforts to fulfil that request and that the United Kingdom agree to heed the call of the international community and put an end to that anachronistic colonial situation. In that context, I wish to reiterate my country’s full readiness to return to the negotiating table and seek a solution that will put an end to this long-standing sovereignty dispute.
We live in a world where injustices and inequalities are increasing. At the same time, democracies are increasingly at risk, peace is crumbling and uncertainty is increasing. We have an urgent moral duty that cannot be postponed, and that is now. We must work and implement effective global agreements that eradicate hunger, drastically reduce inequalities and ensure democratic stability, peace and coexistence. Humankind is threatened. Argentina humbly calls on all the countries of the world to build a new social model that ensures prosperity through social justice."
Armenia,ARM,Asia,"  2,952,000 ",9588,18.23399925,5.1,74.945,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Digestive Disease,98,3.32,"  2,952,000 ",100.00,7.99,"It is an honour to return to the General Assembly, although I wish I were here with a more positive message given all the challenges and tribulations that the world has been through in the past few years. However, my statement will focus on the latest Azerbaijani unprovoked aggression against the sovereign territory of the Republic of Armenia and its overall impact on stability in the South Caucasus.
On 13 September, Azerbaijan launched an unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Armenia. Using heavy artillery, multiple-launch rocket systems and combat unmanned aerial vehicles, the Azerbaijani armed forces shelled 36 residential areas and communities, including the towns of Goris, Jermuk, Vardenis, Kapan and Geghamasar, deep within the sovereign territory of Armenia. That was not a border clash. It was a direct, undeniable attack against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Armenia, which was condemned and addressed during the most recent Security Council meeting (see S/PV.9132) and beyond.
The Azerbaijani attack deliberately targeted the civilian population and vital civilian infrastructure. Jermuk is one of the main health tourism and resort sites of Armenia. As a result of the Azerbaijani aggression, all the hotels, resort facilities and health centres of Jermuk are now closed. All the residents of that town are displaced. Overall, the number of those temporarily displaced from the Gegharkunik, Vayots Dzor and Syunik regions of Armenia is more than 7,600 persons, mostly women and elderly people, among them 1,437 children and 99 persons with disabilities.
Around 192 houses, three hotels, two schools and one medical facility were partially or completely destroyed. Seven electrical infrastructures, five water infrastructures, three gas pipelines and one bridge were damaged. Two ambulances and four private cars were shelled. The Kechut water reservoir was targeted and shelled. Journalists and ambulance vehicles were also targeted and shelled.
As a result of the aggression, at the moment the number of victims and missing persons exceeds 207, among whom three civilians were killed and two civilians are missing. A total of 293 servicemen and eight civilians were wounded; at least 20 servicemen were captured. There is evidence of cases of torture, the mutilation of captured or already dead servicemen and numerous instances of extrajudicial killings and ill-treatment of Armenian prisoners of war, as well as the humiliating treatment of their bodies. The dead bodies of Armenian female military personnel were mutilated and then proudly video-taped by Azerbaijani servicemen with particular cruelty. The videotapes, featuring such gruesome war crimes and crimes against humanity, are being shared and praised on Azerbaijani social media by individual users.
No doubt, committing such unspeakable atrocities is a direct result of a decades-long policy of implanting anti-Armenian hatred and animosity in Azerbaijani society by the political leadership.
In the wake of that offensive, the official narrative and other sources of information suggest that Azerbaijan intends to occupy more territories of Armenia, which needs to be prevented. I want to stress that the risk of a new aggression by Azerbaijan remains very high, especially taking into account the fact that every day Azerbaijan violates the ceasefire, and the number of causalities and those injured could change at any moment. Another factor for further escalation may be the inappropriate reaction to this situation by the regional security organizations, which raised very difficult questions among Armenian society.
Despite the facts I just mentioned, Azerbaijan is trying to present itself as a country seeking peace in our region and peace with Armenia. Hearing from aside what Azerbaijan is saying, one can even be impressed by its devotion to peace efforts. To stage that impression, Azerbaijan is using the subjects of a peace treaty with Armenia, border delimitation and a regional communication opening agenda.
Why have we not made any tangible progress in those directions? The reason is very simple. Azerbaijan is using all those topics for territorial claims against Armenia. For example, one of the most important subjects of a peace treaty is the bilateral recognition of territorial integrity between Armenia and Azerbaijan. We already declared that we were ready to do that, but
so far Azerbaijan has not done so. On the contrary, Azerbaijan has been publicly voicing that the entire south and east of Armenia, and even the capital city of Yerevan, is Azerbaijani land. On the other hand, Azerbaijan is keeping physical territories of Armenia under occupation, and, as I said, the risk of a new aggression by Azerbaijan remains very high.
In that regard, I pose an official and public question to the Azerbaijani President. Could he show the map of Armenia that he recognizes, or is ready to recognize, as the Republic of Armenia? Why I am asking that is because it can come out that, from the point of view of official Azerbaijan, only half of Armenia, or even less, is the Republic of Armenia. If Azerbaijan would recognize the territorial integrity of Armenia, not theoretically, but concretely — I mean the integrity of our internationally recognized territory of 29,800 square kilometres — it would mean that we could sign a peace treaty by mutually recognizing each other’s territorial integrity. Otherwise, we will have a phantom peace treaty, and, after that, Azerbaijan will use the border delimitation process for new territorial claims and occupation.
As Member States may know, the bilateral commission for border delimitation and border security was formed in May, and two meetings of the commission took place. Before the formation of the commission, last year Azerbaijan occupied more than 40 square kilometres of territory of Armenia. One of Azerbaijan’s excuses for the reasons that it did that was that, according to it, Armenia refuses to form a border delimitation commission. Of course, we did not refuse to do that but insisted only that a border-security mechanism should be simultaneously established. In the end, according to a request by our international partners, who argued that the Border Commission’s work itself would be a reliable factor for border security, we agreed to start the work. But now that the Commission for Border Delimitation and Security has been established and is operational, Azerbaijan has initiated a new phase of aggression, while some of those international partners have been silent. So what is the explanation for Azerbaijan’s aggression now? As everyone knows, if someone is excessively aggressive, there is always a reason. As has been said in a movie, it is always possible to find a reason. Why was Prince Hamlet killed? Who killed him, how, when and why? The reason does not matter. The reality is that Azerbaijan is trying to use the delimitation process for territorial claims against Armenia and will continue to do so.
Another related topic is the opening of regional transport communication links. Azerbaijan is trying to portray Armenia as the destructive side in that discussion. The reality is that Armenia is ready to open its roads to Azerbaijan within the framework of our national legislation. The Government also recently published a draft decision proposing to open three checkpoints on the border with Azerbaijan in order to implement article 9 of the trilateral statement of 9 November 2020. According to the draft decision, citizens and goods coming from Azerbaijan would be eligible to use Armenia’s existing roads to commute from Azerbaijan proper to the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The Armenian Government, in a demonstration of political will, was willing to adopt the draft decision unilaterally. But Azerbaijani officials have told us that they do not want those routes. What do they want? They want a new road to be built, which is also acceptable to Armenia. But according to article 9 of the trilateral statement, a new road can be built only with the consent of both sides. Armenia is ready to build that road if its operation is regulated under the legislation and sovereign control of the Republic of Armenia.
What therefore is the point of Azerbaijan’s claims? It is hinting that Armenia must provide an extraterritorial corridor, and, according to Azerbaijan, article 9 of the trilateral statement of 9 November 2020 is supposed to support that claim. The statement is a public document, and in article 9 there is no mention of a corridor, extraterritoriality or any related matters. So what is Azerbaijan’s purpose in this? It is to create a new crisis to provide a pretext for a new aggression against Armenia and a new territorial claim. We have shared packages of proposals with Azerbaijan on the topic of opening communications, and if Azerbaijan accepts the fact that those roads must operate in accordance with national legislation, we can decide that very quickly. By the way, the trilateral statements of 9 November 2020 and 11 January 2021 imply not only that Armenia should provide roads to Azerbaijan, but that Azerbaijan should provide roads to Armenia too. And we have received nothing so far. As for the wording about corridors, it is very important to note that in the trilateral statement of 9 November 2020 only one corridor is mentioned, the Lachin corridor for Nagorno Karabakh.
One of the crucial factors in the stability of our region is a comprehensive settlement of the conflict in Nagorno Karabakh whereby the rights and security of the Armenians living there must be addressed and guaranteed. However, the latest aggression is happening while the humanitarian consequences of the 2020 war in Nagorno Karabakh have yet to be addressed. The post-war rehabilitation of Nagorno Karabakh, the psychosocial issues of the displaced population, the repatriation of Armenian prisoners of war and the preservation of cultural and religious heritage remain on our Government’s agenda. Nevertheless, the Armenians in Nagorno Karabakh are in need of the international community’s support. We call for support for ensuring that United Nations humanitarian agencies have secure and unhindered access to Nagorno Karabakh in order to assess the humanitarian and human rights situation and ensure the protection of cultural heritage on the ground. We believe that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and an independent factfinding mission under the auspices of UNESCO should be granted access to the Nagorno Karabakh conflict zone. Unfortunately, Azerbaijan has been blocking the possibility of a visit by either body by setting artificial, political preconditions, essentially blocking access for an independent fact-finding mission in Nagorno Karabakh. It is also reprehensible that Azerbaijan is stalling the repatriation of Armenian prisoners of war, among other things subjecting them to staged trials in gross violation of international humanitarian law, its own commitments and in contravention of the calls of the international community.
Sustainable regional peace and stability are our objective. Last year, through snap democratic elections, our people strongly supported the Government’s peace agenda and reaffirmed Armenia’s commitment to pursuing its democratic path. It is very important to emphasize that Azerbaijan’s attacks target not only Armenia’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity but its democracy as well. Despite the expectations of certain forces, in the wake of the devastating war of 2020 Armenia has remained democratic, using free, fair and democratic elections as a way to avoid an internal political crisis, a fact that the international community has unanimously recognized and praised. Armenia’s democracy is struggling in an atmosphere in which Azerbaijan is using force every day to unilaterally impose its plans to put an end to our statehood, independence and democracy. But I am here to announce that we are determined to defend our democracy, independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity by every possible means. I want to underscore that diplomatic solutions are an absolute priority for us and that the international community’s full engagement and support are crucial. In that regard, I would like to mention that an international observation mission to the Armenia-Azerbaijan border areas would be an important factor in achieving regional stability. There can be no question that in the interests of regional stability and in accordance with the norms and principles of international law, Azerbaijan’s military forces must be withdrawn from the sovereign territory of the Republic of Armenia.
I want to stress once again that we are determined to build peace in our region, but we need the full support of the international community in standing by our sovereign and democratic country and people, who have been subjected to aggression that goes against the norms and principles of international law. I believe in the possibility that we can establish long-term stability, security and peace, and Armenia is committed to continuing diplomatic efforts to that end."
Australia,AUS,Oceania,"  24,898,000 ",44783,5.590000153,7.2,83.281,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,3150,12.65,"  24,898,000 ",100.00,11.22,"It is my honour to speak on behalf of Australia in the venerated General Assembly Hall, which signifies so much to the world’s peoples. It remains the only place where the whole world has agreed to come together, recognizing that we can solve our biggest problems only together; recognizing that progress and development are preconditions for peace; and recognizing that, to avoid conflict, we must talk to each other and we must listen to each other.
It is my honour to speak on behalf of a country that is home to people from more than 300 different ancestries and to the oldest continuous culture on the planet. Like this Hall, Australia is an assembly of the world’s peoples. When Australians look out to the world, we see ourselves reflected in it. Equally, the world can see itself reflected in Australia, a nation whose people share common ground with so many of the world’s
peoples. It is a nation where half of our people were born overseas or have a parent born overseas. I am one of those people, and the Australian Parliament I serve in is ever more reflective of our modern nation, both enriched by their diversity.
That follows the collective decision of the Australian people to turn the page and write a new future for themselves. Newly elected parliamentarians have origins from across the world and indigenous Australians have been elected in record numbers and serve in the Ministry in record numbers. The new Australian Government is determined to make real progress on the national journey of healing with indigenous Australians — the first peoples of our continent. As Foreign Minister, I am determined to see First Nations perspectives at the heart of Australian foreign policy. This week, I have been encouraged by discussions with other countries on their own journeys.
I am humbled to be guided in those efforts by First Nations colleagues. Here in New York, I am joined by Senator Patrick Dodson. To many Australians, Senator Dodson is the father of reconciliation. Senator Dodson is a Yawuru man from Broome, in the remote northwest of Australia. Like many First Nations people, he walks in two worlds — as a Senator and leader in our Parliament; and as an elder, native title holder and ceremony man for his people. In our Government, Senator Dodson has been tasked with responding to a call from First Nations people for a constitutionally enshrined voice to the Australian Parliament, as well as treaty and truth-telling.
With daunting challenges facing the world, we have much to learn from First Nations peoples, both at home and in international forums. Elevating First Nations voices, including right here, has never been more important.
Our nation’s history and present show that, like anything human — indeed, like this institution in which we gather — we are not perfect. But we aim ever-higher and we look to make our contribution to the world. Australians see our country as it is and we see our world as it is, and we seek to shape them for the better. Sharing common ground with so many of the world’s peoples means that Australians want to see the interests of all the world’s peoples upheld, along with our own.
That aim of today’s Australia accords with the ambition of an Australian who helped shape the Charter of the United Nations, our former Foreign Minister and the third President of the General Assembly, Mr. Herbert Evatt. At the 1945 San Francisco Conference, where the Charter was written, Mr. Evatt challenged the great Powers. They wanted a strong Security Council that had control over the General Assembly. Mr. Evatt did not succeed in his fight against the great Powers’ veto within the Security Council, but he did succeed in ensuring that the General Assembly had the ability to decide its own course and could address any matter that falls within the Charter of the United Nations or the powers and functions of any of its organs.
He understood that small and medium-sized countries cannot simply allow their fates to be decided by the great Powers. He understood that small and medium-sized countries must be able to maintain their sovereign choices, protected by a stable framework of rules. He also understood that, in order to maintain those sovereign choices, the small and medium-sized countries of the world, including Australia, must work together. Those are legacies that we renew today.
Mr. Evatt also saw economic and social security as the precondition for peace. He pressed the San Francisco Conference to ensure that the United Nations addressed the broadest range of social, economic and human rights issues, saying:
“Real stability... can only be achieved by building an organization that will do its utmost to assure the peoples of the world a full opportunity in living in freedom from want as well as in freedom from external aggression.”
Some did not want to extend the ambit of the United Nations to economic and social development. On behalf of Australia, Evatt insisted. Again, those are legacies Australia renews today.
Despite inheriting the biggest debt in our nation’s history, the new Australian Government is determined to play its part in supporting the development of other nations, particularly in our region. We are alarmed that, for the first time, the United Nations Human Development Index declined for two consecutive years, in 2020 and 2021. The impact of that decline has been most severe on women and girls, with nearly half a billion women and girls now living in extreme poverty.
The global food security crisis is increasingly grave. More than 800 million people go to bed hungry every night, 345 million people face acute food insecurity, and
50 million people across 45 countries are on the brink of famine. That is a growing scale of human suffering that threatens untold global instability. Australia is increasing our contribution to development assistance by over a billion dollars. If we are ever to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, which represent our collective vision for minimum living standards for everyone living on this planet, every country needs to do more. Over the coming months, we are designing a new development policy outlining how we will play our part in an era of crisis and how we will help developing countries without driving them into unsustainable debt.
The world has experienced disasters and conflict in the past, but the intensity and confluence of today’s challenges in an interconnected world are without precedent. The coronavirus disease has set back development gains. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has unleashed further suffering and made it harder for populations to recover from the pandemic. Drought and potential famine plague the Horn of Africa. We have seen major floods in Pakistan and record-breaking heatwaves in Europe and Asia. The alarm bells of climate change are growing louder, including in my own country.
Australians are clear that they want urgent and serious action, and they have given their Government a mandate. Among the first acts of the new Australian Government has been to submit our ambitious nationally determined contribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and we have just passed legislation that makes those targets law. Our climate policies mean that within this decade, 83 per cent of Australia’s energy supply will be renewable. We want to help the global energy transition. Australia will be a renewable energy super-Power.
And while we are playing our part to reduce our own emissions, we are working in our region to support Pacific countries, which have the most to lose from the changing climate. Nothing is more central to the security and economies of the Pacific than climate change. As Pacific leaders themselves put it plainly in the first article of the 2018 Pacific Island Forum’s Boe Declaration on Regional Security, we reaffirm that climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and well-being of the peoples of the Pacific and our commitment to progressing the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
Australians are part of the Pacific family, and families are about care, love and forgiveness. But they are also about duty and loyalty, looking out for each other and listening to each other. The Australian people want to be better, more involved and more helpful members of the Pacific family. In my first months as Foreign Minister, I have visited six Pacific Islands Forum countries. It is a clear sign of our priorities that, by the end of this year, I will have visited nearly all of them.
Australians want to enhance our defence, maritime and economic cooperation with Pacific Island countries because our peace and prosperity are one. And we want to be the Pacific’s partner of choice for development and security. We are increasing our development assistance to the Pacific by over half a billion dollars, and we are working with our Pacific partners to address our shared challenges and implement the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. We want to bridge our cooperation across the Pacific and South-East Asia to address shared challenges and to build the region we want.
Australia seeks deeper engagement with South- East Asia. It is a region I know well. It is the region I am from. The region is being reshaped, and Australia seeks to work with its partners in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to shape this period of change together. Australia seeks a region that is peaceful and predictable; that is governed by accepted rules and norms, where all our countries and peoples can cooperate, trade and thrive; where our relations are based on respect and partnership and guided by the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific; where all States can contribute to a strategic equilibrium in a regional order in which countries are not required to choose sides, but can make their own sovereign choices.
We recognize we must bring more to the table in South-East Asia. That starts with an additional $470 million in development assistance and a forthcoming strategy on economic engagement. We must contribute to the strategic balance of the region. We do not want to see any one country dominating or any country being dominated.
We cannot accept a situation where large countries determine the fate of smaller countries. That is why Russia’s illegal, immoral invasion of Ukraine cannot be normalized and cannot be minimized. Russia’s attack on Ukraine is an attack on all smaller countries. It is an
assertion that a larger country is entitled to subjugate a smaller neighbour to decide whether another country can even exist.
It was never intended that the Security Council veto power would be used to enable unchecked abuse of the Charter of the United Nations by the very countries that were given the veto. So it is especially important for countries that play leading roles in international forums and countries with influence on Russia to exert their influence to end that war. In that regard, the world looks to China, a great Power, a permanent member of the Security Council with a no-limits partnership with Russia.
Mr. Putin’s weak and desperate nuclear threats underline the danger that nuclear weapons pose to us all and the urgent need for progress on nuclear disarmament. Australia has always pursued a world without nuclear weapons. We will redouble our efforts towards that goal and to strengthen the non-proliferation regime.
The death and destruction in Ukraine remind us all how much we have to lose if we fail to protect the Charter of the United Nations. It reminds us that each nation must make its own choices and exercise its own agency. We cannot leave it to the big Powers, and we cannot be passive when big Powers flout the rules.
Aside from terrible damage and the loss of life in Ukraine, Russia’s invasion is compounding human suffering and propelling the global crisis in food and energy security. In my own region, where geopolitical contest becomes ever sharper, we must ensure that competition does not escalate into conflict, because if conflict were to break out in the Indo-Pacific, it would be catastrophic for our people and our prosperity.
And with the Indo-Pacific’s centrality to global prosperity and security, the cost would extend far beyond our region and reach into every life. So I say to small and medium-sized nations like my own: We are more than just supporting players in a grand drama of global geopolitics on a stage dominated by great Powers. It is up to all of us to create the kind of world to which we aspire — stable, peaceful, prosperous and respectful of sovereignty. That is the very rationale for the United Nations itself.
It is up to all of us to ask ourselves how we can each use our State power, our influence, our networks and our capabilities to avert catastrophic conflict. How do we acquit our responsibilities to constrain tensions, to apply the brakes before the momentum for conflict in our region or beyond becomes unstoppable?
Australia is resolved to those tasks in all our diplomacy in the United Nations and beyond. It is why we seek a seat on the Security Council for 2029-2030. It is why we seek reform of the Security Council, with greater permanent representation for Africa, Latin America and Asia, including India and Japan. Being genuinely committed to the United Nations means being genuinely committed to reforming the United Nations and keeping it vital.
We know that we will always be better off in a world where rules and norms — whether on trade, the maritime domain or military engagement, on the environment or human rights — are clear, mutually negotiated and consistently followed. History teaches us that the alternative to what we have built here is conflict and chaos — a world where differences and disputes are settled by size and power alone, instead of by agreed rules and norms.
Humankind has benefited from the multilateral system. Humankind has benefited from the rules that have underpinned an unequalled period of human development. Humankind will pay the price if we allow it to flounder — every nation and all our peoples."
Austria,AUT,Europe,"  8,891,000 ",45010,5.5,7.4,81.434,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,1307,14.70,"  8,891,000 ",100.00,10.91,"When we met in this Hall last year, I was cautiously optimistic that the world would slowly but surely find its footing after the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. My call then was to look forward and focus on strengthening our resilience and preserving our hard-earned development goals (see A/76/PV.11). Little did we know then that only one year later we would find ourselves in a very different world, facing another crisis with tremendous global consequences that reach beyond the pandemic.
On 24 February, war returned to Europe when Russia brutally attacked Ukraine, an independent and sovereign country. Russia is trying to redraw borders using tanks and rockets — something that the world has not seen since Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait. It is using explicit nuclear blackmail and fake referendums in clear violation of international law. Its war of aggression against Ukraine has destroyed many illusions — the illusion that the security architecture that we created after the fall of the Iron Curtain would continue to pay a peace dividend, guaranteeing stability and security; that the European peace project would prevent war on our continent; and that crises and tensions can and would ultimately be solved by peaceful means, through dialogue and diplomacy.
Russia’s attack was like a geopolitical ice bucket thrown at our face, brutally tearing us from our daydreams of a post-historical and post-national Europe. Deep within us, we clung to the belief that Francis Fukuyama might still be right with his The End of History, at least as far as Europe was concerned. And we trusted that we had learned our lessons after the two horrific World Wars, half a century of the Cold War and the Iron Curtain dividing our continent. Looking back, we have to admit that we were perhaps delusional, naive and, yes, maybe even foolish. Indeed, our holiday from history is over.
Many in this Hall might now think: Why do Europeans make such noise and a fuss over it? They might point to the fact that war and military conflict are an everyday reality in many parts of the planet. They might even accuse us of applying double standards and contend that we only react so strongly to Russia’s invasion because of geographic and cultural proximity, or because the Ukrainians look like us. I firmly reject such a narrative. Let me be very clear: this is a war in Europe, but it is not a European war. In fact, it is an assault against the rules-based international order, which we all established together over the past decades. It is a flagrant and deliberate breach of the founding Charter of this very Organization — our United Nations.
In the Charter, every single State in this Hall has committed to settle international disputes by peaceful means and to refrain from the threat of use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State. What is worse is that this breach has been committed not by any State, but by a permanent member of the Security Council — the very organ responsible for upholding the Charter and ensuring international peace and security. That puts into question the very foundations of our security and stability.
All of a sudden, we find ourselves in a world in which the rule of law risks being replaced by the law of the jungle. Honestly, such a world poses a fundamental threat to us all, especially to smaller countries, such as Austria — countries that rely on international law as their shield and their protective cloak against unilateralism and the use of force. I firmly believe that the ideas and principles laid down in the Charter are as valid today as they were 77 years ago, when, in 1945,
in his address to the San Francisco Conference, former United States President Harry Truman said,
“We can no longer permit any nation, or group of nations, to attempt to settle their arguments with bombs and bayonets. If we continue to abide by such decisions, we will be forced to accept the fundamental concept of our enemies, namely, that, ‘Might makes right’”.
Those words have not lost their truth or validity. Are we really incapable of learning from history? We are once again facing a country that is attempting to settle its neo-imperialistic score by using bombs and bayonets, targeting civilians and committing atrocities that may amount to war crimes under international humanitarian law. And those bombs and bayonets are not only targeting Ukrainians. They are also targeting the world’s most vulnerable countries, pushing them into a triple crisis of food, energy and financing shortages.
Let me be very clear here: We should not confuse cause and effect. We have to place responsibility firmly where it belongs. Some try to spread the narrative that the triple crisis of food, energy and financing is somehow connected to the sanctions imposed by the European Union on the Russian Federation. That is simply wrong. To put it very clearly, there are no sanctions whatsoever on the exports of grain, oilseeds, other foodstuffs, fertilizers or gas to third countries. Instead, it is actually the Russian Federation that is cynically using food and energy as a weapon, pushing millions of vulnerable people around the world into poverty, hunger and debt. According to the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance, the triple crisis involving the latter is now affecting 1.7 billion people around the planet. Not even the Soviet Union went that far.
We are living in an era of transformation, with the COVID-19 pandemic, global food and energy shortages, the soaring rise in the cost of living, rapid technological change, climate change and the prospect of a very bumpy road ahead of us as far as the world economy is concerned. Those are indeed scary perspectives. It is no wonder that our citizens feel anxious and insecure. A storm is brewing that will seriously affect millions of people, especially the most vulnerable. That is a recipe for disaster, potentially leading to mass migration and social and political tensions.
We rapidly have to take countermeasures, not only nationally but in global solidarity. This year, Austria is spending more on development assistance and humanitarian aid than ever before, and next year we will increase our respective budgets even more. But we all know in this Hall that no Government alone can shoulder those challenges. We desperately need a functioning multilateral system. We need a rules- based international order with the United Nations at its core. Our security depends on States respecting one another’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Our political stability rests on the principle of pacta sunt servanda. And our economic prosperity requires functioning export markets and secure supply lines.
The war in Ukraine is not a conflict of East versus West or North versus South. The dividing line runs clearly between the rule of law and the law of the jungle. International law is valid for everyone, no matter the geographical, religious or ethnic context. There is no such thing as first-class or second-class international law. Civilians need to be protected, whether in Mariupol or in the villages of Yemen. Fundamental freedoms and human rights, especially the rights of women and girls, must be respected, whether in Crimea or in Kabul.
Using hunger as a weapon is simply unacceptable, whether by blocking shipments out of Odesa or by preventing humanitarian aid from reaching the province of Tigray. There needs to be accountability for war crimes, whether they happen in Bucha or Aleppo. I am proud that Vienna is host to the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine. We, the Austrians, will continue to actively support the efforts by the International Criminal Court to shed light on the savage acts committed in Ukraine.
Effective multilateralism and respect for the rule of law have been at the core of Austria’s foreign policy for decades, as symbolized by the United Nations Headquarters in Vienna and our willingness to take on even more responsibility as a candidate in the 2026 elections for a non-permanent member seat on the Security Council. We count on State Members’ support. Constructive dialogue and pragmatic diplomacy will continue to be our guide. It is what Austria as an open and democratic society simply stands for.
I truly believe that we are facing the most challenging time of our political generation. Our actions today will shape the future of our international system, which rose out of the ashes of the two horrible World Wars and the end of the Cold War. I am not saying that the system is perfect — far from it — but at least it is a system in which we are striving to create a world where the rights of all people and the sovereignty of every nation are
respected and peace, sustainability and social justice are possible.
Obviously, these times are heydays for doomsayers. Yet I remain confident that we can and will prevail. Why, one might ask? It is because I deeply believe that our societies based on freedom, pluralism and individual rights are remarkably resilient and have proven so during the pandemic — not despite, but because of our vibrant political debates, opposing opinions, critical media and civil society. They are the key reasons and ingredients that we continue to innovate, adapt and learn from our mistakes to rise in the face of adversity.
I want my children and grandchildren to be able to grow up in a world where rules are applied and respected; where they can live their lives in freedom and without fear; and where might does not make right. Yesterday’s speech by President Vladimir Putin of Russia made it obvious that this conflict will not be over very soon. But let us not give in to fear, self-doubt or defeatism. Let us be steadfast. Let us stand ready to defend our values — the values of the United Nations."

You can count on the full support of the Republic of Azerbaijan throughout your tenure. I also wish to thank the outgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for his hard work over the past year.
Azerbaijan is well known for its contribution to promoting intercultural and interfaith dialogue. The Baku process launched in 2008 by the Government of Azerbaijan, together with the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations, the Council of Europe, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Islamic World Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (ISESCO) and others, has set standards and agendas for dialogue and intercultural cooperation. The important role of the Baku process in advocating dialogue among cultures has been recognized in the reports of the Secretary-General.
Based on the successful experience of the Baku process, Azerbaijan, in partnership with the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations and ISESCO, launched in June 2021 a new international initiative entitled Peace4Culture Global Call, the aim of which is to contribute to sustainable peace, development and the protection of cultural heritage. We believe that this initiative will be equally successful, and invite all countries and international organizations to join this project.
The world continues to face the serious challenges that the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has raised. Despite the fact that expanding vaccination rates and the increasing adaptivity of the global population to new realities offer a glimpse of hope for the post-COVID period, serious challenges remain. All immediate and long-term challenges brought by the pandemic necessitate new mechanisms supported, by high-level political engagement, that would provide a comprehensive framework for global cooperation and solidarity.
From the very beginning, Azerbaijan, in its national capacity and as Chair of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), has advocated greater global solidarity to overcome the pandemic and put forward a number of global initiatives to that end. The initiative of President Ilham Aliyev, in his capacity as Chair of the Non-Aligned Movement, to convene a special session of the General Assembly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic enjoyed broad support of the United Nations membership. On behalf of NAM, Azerbaijan also submitted resolutions on ensuring equal, affordable, timely and universal access to COVID-19 vaccines, which were adopted by the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council with the overwhelming support of Member States.
Along with an effective vaccination campaign in the country, Azerbaijan has donated a significant number of COVID-19 vaccines to countries in need. We have provided international assistance to more than 80 countries to combat the pandemic. We will continue our endeavours aimed at further strengthening international cooperation in addressing the consequences of the pandemic and consolidating efforts for global recovery from COVID-19. The President of Azerbaijan, in that regard, has initiated the establishment of a high-level United Nations panel on post-pandemic global recovery, which will be among the topics to be elaborated on at the upcoming summit-level meeting of the NAM Contact Group in response to COVID-19, to be held in Baku in the coming months.
Since gaining its independence, Azerbaijan has made a long journey, transforming from a country with imposed security challenges on its own soil into a contributor to global security. Along the way, Azerbaijan has been a strong and reliable partner of the United Nations, staunchly supported it and actively contributed to its activities. Both in its national capacity and as current Chair of the Non-Aligned Movement, Azerbaijan is keen to continue contributing to peace and security, strengthening the international legal order and enhancing dialogue, global solidarity and multilateralism. We also look forward to the Summit of the Future, its intergovernmentally negotiated outcome and a new agenda for peace as an opportunity to reinvigorate global action and reflect on collective commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and multilateralism.
Azerbaijan is fully committed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We have launched a new development strategy up to 2030, which goes hand in hand with the 2030 Agenda. Over the past year, Azerbaijan has progressed further in terms of its achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and is ranked in the top 50 countries in the United Nations Sustainable Development Report 2022. Azerbaijan is among 12 countries that have submitted three voluntary national reviews to the High-level Political Forum, held under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council.
We pursue transformational changes in remodelling our economy to make the transition to a green and circular economy. The clean environment and green growth have been identified as among the five priority areas of our new national development strategy. This transition stands high on our development agenda, despite the fact that the oil and gas sector plays a significant role in our economy. It is against that backdrop that the non-oil sector of Azerbaijan rose by 11 per cent in the first half of 2022, triggering an increase in our gross domestic product by 7.2 per cent.
Currently, Azerbaijan is one of the few countries worldwide that are gradually mainstreaming sustainable energy into its development agenda, while being a reliable hydrocarbons exporter to international markets. We will increase our profile in that regard, including by introducing new elements of alternative and renewable energy as well. A recently concluded European Union-Azerbaijan memorandum of understanding on a strategic partnership in the field of energy is a good example of Azerbaijan’s constructive input into global energy security.
Sustainability has also been mainstreamed in postconflict reconstruction and rehabilitation activities, including in the liberated territories. New cities and villages are now being built from scratch by applying modern urban planning methods, the concepts of “smart city” and “smart village”. After the war, $3 billion have already been allocated from the State budget for those purposes, and Azerbaijan is keen to invest even more in the future. The liberated area has been designated as a green energy zone.
Positioned at the crossroads of North-South and East-West transport corridors, Azerbaijan is a rising transit country. Corridors and routes passing through Azerbaijan offer competitive advantages for transport operators and businesses in terms of high-end infrastructure and fast, secure transit traffic.
This year marks thirtieth anniversary of admission of the Republic of Azerbaijan to membership of the United Nations. Since becoming part of the United Nations family, Azerbaijan has consistently demonstrated its strong commitment to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and international law. We joined the United Nations at a time when the very principles, that the Organization stands for were being blatantly violated in relation to Azerbaijan. In those difficult times, the United Nations stood with Azerbaijan in defending the core values enshrined in its Charter.
Azerbaijan suffered grievously from the aggression of Armenia in the early 1990s, at the core of which were groundless territorial claims, misinterpretations of international law, fabricated historical narratives and racist motivations. Back then, the Security Council unanimously expressed its support for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability of the internationally recognized borders of Azerbaijan, and demanded the withdrawal of all occupying forces from Azerbaijani territories, as did the General Assembly.
In the course of its aggression, Armenia occupied 20 per cent of Azerbaijan’s territory. Twenty thousand Azerbaijanis were killed and more than 1 million became refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). Almost 4,000 citizens of Azerbaijan, civilian and military alike, remain missing in connection with the conflict.
Armenia has inflicted long-term damage on the environment in Azerbaijan. Also, thousands of Azerbaijani cultural heritage objects have been destroyed, plundered or misappropriated by Armenia. Earlier this year, ISESCO sent a technical mission to Azerbaijan to undertake a post-conflict state of conservation assessment of the cultural heritage in its liberated territories. For decades, Azerbaijan has called on Armenia to support an independent, transparent UNESCO mission to assess and advise on the protection and preservation of cultural heritage in the region. Although the Armenian occupation of Azerbaijan’s territory ended in 2020, a UNESCO mission has yet to arrive, and I once again publicly call for such a mission.
The scale of violations and destruction demonstrates a clear intent and purpose to terrorize, kill and expel Azerbaijani civilians and erase all traces of Azerbaijan from those territories. Within almost 30 years, Armenia, having committed ethnic cleansing, carried out an illegal settlement policy by transferring Armenians en masse from Armenia and third countries to the occupied territories of Azerbaijan, in blatant violation of international humanitarian law, with the aim of preventing Azerbaijanis from return to their places of origin and securing the annexation of these territories. Conflict resolution efforts under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe yielded no results.
Almost 30 years on, in the autumn of 2020, Azerbaijan, in response to yet another large-scale military provocation by Armenia and guided by the inherent rights conferred upon the Member States by the United Nations Charter, launched a counteroffensive operation. As a result, Azerbaijan liberated its territories and the three-decade armed conflict was resolved by military and political means, in line with the trilateral statement signed by the leaders of Azerbaijan, Russia and Armenia on 10 November 2020. The trilateral statement announced the end of all military activities between Armenia and Azerbaijan. It set the parameters for consolidating peace in the region, such as the complete withdrawal of all Armenian armed units from the territory of Azerbaijan, the return of displaced persons and the unblocking of all economic and transport connections in the region.
Azerbaijan has now embarked upon unprecedented recovery and reconstruction activities in the liberated territories and prioritized their full reintegration. Such activities are aimed at finally enabling hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons to return to their homes in safety and dignity and at ensuring a peaceful life in conflict-affected territories. The first families have recently returned to Aghali village, in the liberated Zangilan district of Azerbaijan.
Azerbaijan is resolved to reintegrate its citizens of Armenian origin residing in conflict-affected territories into its political, social and economic space, guaranteeing them the same rights and freedoms enjoyed by all the citizens of Azerbaijan regardless of their ethnic, religious or any other affiliation. The Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan provides a solid legal framework in this regard.
One of the major impediments to the ongoing recovery and reconstruction efforts and the safe return of displaced persons is a massive contamination of liberated territories by landmines and other explosive devices, and the continued refusal of Armenia to provide accurate and complete information on mined areas. Over the years of occupation of and during withdrawal of its forces from Azerbaijani territories, Armenia heavily and indiscriminately contaminated those areas with mines and other explosive hazards. Since the signing of trilateral statement, more than 240 Azerbaijani civilians and military have been killed or seriously injured by mine explosions.
Obtaining the maps of minefields, along with targeted and sustainable international technical and financial assistance to further strengthen and increase national mine action capacities and efforts in Azerbaijan, will be critically important to saving lives and strengthening peace. Sustainable United Nations support and adequate and predictable mine action funding are indispensable.
Azerbaijan is committed to regional peace, stability and development. The establishment of good- neighbourly relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan is key to building a secure, stable and prosperous South Caucasus through full-fledged regional normalization. Along with carrying out large-scale recovery and reconstruction works in the liberated territories, and pursuing the reintegration of residents in conflict- affected territories, Azerbaijan has initiated the process of normalizing inter-State relations with Armenia based on mutual recognition and respect for each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within their State borders.
On numerous occasions, Azerbaijan has expressed its readiness to start negotiations on peace treaty between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and has established its national delegation to that end. Equally, Azerbaijan has undertaken efforts to start the process of the delimitation and demarcation of state borders between Armenia and Azerbaijan, unblocking transportation and communication links, including the establishment of the Zangezur corridor, which is a part of the international transportation network.
Notwithstanding the increased dynamism in contacts, including direct dialogue between Armenia and Azerbaijan in recent months, Armenia seems to be sticking to its past practice of engaging in sham negotiations, and instead implementing its commitments in good faith, frequently resorts to provocations and sabotage to exacerbate tensions and undermine ongoing normalization process with Azerbaijan. Armenia has not fully withdrawn its armed forces from Azerbaijani territories, as stipulated by the 10 November trilateral statement, and continues a variety of military activities within the territories of Azerbaijan, including planting landmines. Recently, massive numbers of anti-personnel mines produced in Armenia in 2021 have been found in the Lachin district of Azerbaijan.
Following a series of political and military provocations, especially after the fourth Brussels meeting between the leaders of the two countries, Armenia resorted to another large-scale military provocation along the undelimited State borderline in the night of 12 to 13 September, attempting to plant mines on the roads between the military positions of Azerbaijan, taking advantage of the night and the complex terrain. Later, Armenia, using weapons of different calibres, opened fire on Azerbaijani positions, which caused losses among the military personnel of Azerbaijan and inflicted significant damage on its military infrastructure.
Azerbaijan took adequate measures to neutralize the threat against its sovereignty and territorial integrity and ensure the safety of its personnel, as well as civilian personnel involved in reconstruction works in the area. The armed forces of Azerbaijan demonstrated the utmost restraint and professionalism, and limited themselves to exclusively targeting Armenia’s firing positions with high-precision weapons to suppress its attacks on the positions of Azerbaijan.
Armenia clearly attempted a further escalation to manipulate the attention of the international community. Thus, Armenia disregarded the ceasefire agreed on 13 September and continued shelling the territory of Azerbaijan, including with high-calibre weapons and artillery. As a result, Azerbaijan suffered further losses and casualties, included 80 servicemen killed and 282 servicemen and 2 civilians wounded.
Contrary to such reckless actions of Armenia, Azerbaijan exercised the utmost restraint, took several steps, including through contacts with relevant international partners, and demonstrated good faith and genuine will to restore the ceasefire. Eventually the ceasefire was restored effective 8 p.m. on 14 September through direct communication channels between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and is being maintained, as confirmed by both sides.
In the aftermath of the escalation, Azerbaijan has been engaged in addressing the humanitarian consequences. In that context, it declared its willingness to return to Armenia the remains of deceased military personnel on a unilateral basis, and informed the International Committee of the Red Cross accordingly.
Azerbaijan is not and cannot be interested in tension. As a matter of fact, the latest hostilities erupted in close proximity to areas where impressive large-scale post-conflict investment, rehabilitation and reconstruction projects are under way. Furthermore, the latest escalation of tension fits very well into the pattern we have observed over the past 30 years from Armenia. Each time a decisive stage has been reached towards a breakthrough, Armenia has resorted to similar serious provocation as a mean of shirking the responsibility of taking necessary decisions. We would have wished that the current leadership of Armenia were not following the path of its predecessors by deliberately closing yet again the window of opportunity for peace and security in the region.
Azerbaijan is resolute in further repelling any threat to its sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as to the safety of its citizens, and urges Armenia to refrain from further escalating the situation. Instead, Armenia has to constructively engage in the ongoing normalization process in order to establish a predictable, stable situation in the region through the establishment of good-neighbourly relations.
In that context, following the agreement reached at the fourth meeting of the leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia with the President of the European Council, held on 31 August in Brussels, Azerbaijan reiterated to Armenia its readiness to start practical work on the peace treaty without further delay. Immediately after the meeting, we proposed a concrete date and venue to Armenia for such talks.
Two days ago we listened to the statement delivered here by the Prime Minister of Armenia (see A/77/ PV.9). Regrettably, this was yet further evidence demonstrating that the Armenian side seems focused on continuing the confrontation instead of normalization. In Azerbaijan, we believe that our region has seen enough confrontation, destruction and suffering. It is high time for both our nations to engage fully and wholeheartedly in post-conflict normalization so that we can finally turn the tragic page of our history and start building a better future for our children. The commitment of the Azerbaijani side is there. We hope that Armenia will finally reciprocate constructively and engage genuinely in the negotiations.
Having liberated its territories from a long-term foreign military occupation, Azerbaijan is determined to spare no effort towards their full reconstruction and reintegration, in accordance with the highest possible standards. At the same time, our country will continue to play the role of responsible member of the international community in all relevant fields, whether it is contributing to global energy security, helping fight the COVID-19 pandemic or promoting sustainable development. We believe that, in a globalized world, no country is an island, and we act accordingly."

I assure him of my delegation’s full cooperation throughout the session. I also commend his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid. I would like to express my deep appreciation to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his strong commitment to making the United Nations more vibrant in its responsibilities.
The theme of this year’s general debate is “A watershed moment:	transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”. Our planet Earth today is plagued by multiple complex and multidimensional challenges, such as climate change, violence and conflict, and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. This year’s theme calls for united efforts to find ways to overcome those challenges and revitalize our economy to build a peaceful and sustainable world. To achieve that goal, we need to act collectively without delay.
We believe that antagonism, like war, economic sanctions and counter-sanctions can never bring good to any nation. Mutual dialogue is the best way to resolve crises and disputes. In that context, I thank the Secretary-General for setting up the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance. As a champion of the Group, I am working with other world leaders to identify a global solution commensurate with the gravity and depth of the current situation.
The father of the nation of Bangladesh, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, formulated our foreign policy dictum “friendship to all, malice towards none”. Bangladesh has been pursuing that principle of non-alignment since its independence. In his maiden address to the Assembly on 25 September 1974, he said:
“Our total commitment to peace is born of the realization that only an environment of peace would enable us to enjoy the fruits of our hard- won national independence and to mobilize and concentrate all our energies and resources in combating the scourges of poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy and unemployment.
“We therefore welcome every effort aimed at advancing the process of detente, relaxation of tension, limitation of armaments and the promotion of peaceful coexistence in every part of the world, whether in Asia, Africa, Europe or Latin America.” (A/PV.2243, p.160)
That statement of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib is still equally relevant in the present global context. Bangabandhu believed that peace is the embodiment of the aspirations of all men and women in the world. As a result of war, human beings, especially women and children, suffer tremendously. Many people become refugees.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have adopted strategies to contain the crisis, mainly focusing on three aspects. First, we expanded national health care to prevent the transmission and spread of the infection. Secondly, we have provided strategic fiscal stimulus to safeguard our economy. Thirdly, we have secured people’s livelihoods. Those initiatives have helped reduce the number of deaths due to the pandemic as well as reduce public sufferings. Vaccination is the key to our safe transition from the pandemic. We thank the World Health Organization and its COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) system and our partner countries for providing this vaccine. As of August, 100 per cent of the eligible population of Bangladesh had been vaccinated.
We are working towards sustainable economic growth, creating equal opportunities for all and realizing an inclusive peaceful society and social harmony. Bangladesh is now one of the five fastest growing economies in the world. We are forty-first in terms of gross domestic product (GDP). We have reduced the poverty rate from 41 per cent to 20.5 per cent over the past decade. Our per capita income has tripled to $2,824 in just one decade. Before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, our GDP growth rate in fiscal year 2018-2019 was 8.15 per cent. Earlier, we achieved GDP growth of over 7 per cent for three consecutive years. Even during the pandemic, the economy of Bangladesh expanded by 6.94 per cent in the fiscal year 2020-2021. However, as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war, economic sanctions and counter-sanctions, there has been a supply chain disruption and exorbitant price hikes for fuel, food and consumer goods. That has put economies like ours under tremendous pressure. Inflation has been increased. We are taking various initiatives to overcome this situation.
In 2026, Bangladesh is going to graduate from least developed countries category to that of developing country. We are working to transform Bangladesh into a knowledge-based developed country by 2041 and building a prosperous and climate-resilient delta by 2100.
Bangladesh has achieved significant progress in universal primary education, food security, the reduction of maternal and child mortality, gender equality, women’s empowerment and so on. The literacy rate has increased from 50 per cent to 75 per cent in the past decade. We have placed great emphasis on ensuring an information technology-based education system. Our infant mortality rate has declined to 21 per 1,000 live births, and the maternal mortality rate has decreased to 173 per 100,000 live births. The average life expectancy of our people is now more than 73 years. We have paid special attention to the most vulnerable people in society so that no one is left behind. The coverage of the existing social safety net has been expanded to ensure the social and financial security of destitute women, widows, the elderly, persons with disabilities, third gender people and other vulnerable segments of society. Currently, about 10.7 million people are receiving direct benefits under the social safety net.
Improved physical infrastructure serves as the foundation for a strong economic structure. That is why we are building massive sustainable infrastructure, including underwater tunnels, elevated expressways and mass rapid transit systems. Recently, we have added the Padma Multipurpose Bridge, a self-funded asset, to our road communications system. It will facilitate Bangladesh’s local and international trade and enhance regional connectivity. That will ensure at least 1.23 per cent growth in our national income.
The impact of climate change is one of the biggest threats to humankind. In the past, we have seen a vicious cycle of promises being made and broken. We must now change this course. In Bangladesh, we have led many transformative measures to tackle the perilous impacts of climate change, consistent with the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. During our presidency of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, we launched the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan, which is aimed at putting Bangladesh on a sustainable trajectory from vulnerability to resilience and climate prosperity. Our national plans and policies on climate change and natural disaster have been made gender sensitive. We are ready to support other vulnerable countries to develop their own prosperity plans. I call on world leaders to promote inclusive climate actions.
Migrants continue to face precarious situations in their migration journeys and are denied their rights. To overcome that situation, we must enhance global partnership and solidarity. The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration and its Progress Declaration give us an excellent road map in that regard.
Today complex global crises have reversed decades of development gains of many developing countries.
The realization of the 2030 Agenda appears to be a farfetched dream for many of them at this moment. They need targeted support in areas that are severely impacted, including health, education, decent jobs and agriculture. There is no better way than harnessing the potentials of science, technology and innovation. We are witnessing how frontier technologies are rapidly changing the world. It is imperative that everyone, everywhere gets fair and equal access to these technologies. The burgeoning digital divide must be bridged.
Sixteen countries, including Bangladesh, are now on track to graduate from the list of least developed countries. However, the evolving global crises have posed serious challenges to our sustainable graduation. We appeal to development partners for enhanced and tailored support. We welcome the Doha Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries in that regard.
After the peaceful settlement of maritime boundary issues with neighbouring countries, the blue economy has opened a new horizon for the development of Bangladesh. We are committed to working with global partners for the sustainable use, conservation and management of our marine resources to accelerate our socioeconomic development. The effective implementation of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is imperative to harnessing sustainable utilization of ocean resources. In that regard, I also call upon Member States to work closely to bridge the gaps and conclude the much- needed international instrument on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction.
We are fully committed to complete disarmament, including the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. We ratified the landmark Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in 2019. We have consistently implemented our commitment to peacekeeping operations. As a reflection of our peace-centric foreign policy, we are the largest contributor of troops and police to United Nations peacekeeping missions. They help maintain peace, support the capacity-building of national and local institutions, protect civilians from harm, empower women and other vulnerable communities and build a sustainable society. While performing those duties, many of them have sacrificed their lives.
We believe that we cannot sustain peace without addressing the root causes of conflict. As the current Chair of the Peacebuilding Commission, we are doing our part by creating a platform for multi-stakeholder engagement in support of the conflict-affected countries. We are committed to pursuing our efforts to strengthen the women and peace and security agenda. We have adopted a zero-tolerance policy on terrorism and violent extremism. We do not allow our territory to be used by any party to incite or cause terrorist acts or harm to others. I also call on Member States to work together for the conclusion of an internationally binding instrument to tackle cybercrime and cyberviolence.
As a responsible Member Sate, Bangladesh is fully committed to protecting and promoting the human rights of its own people. We have adopted a holistic and inclusive approach to ensuring the political, economic, cultural and social rights of the people. For example, we have adopted legal provisions to ensure the rights and welfare of third-gender individuals. We have been implementing the Ashrayan project to provide free housing to all homeless and landless families in the country. Since 1997 and for 18 years during the tenure of my Government, we have provided housing to more than 3.5 million people.
We believe that continued democratic polity and norms can ensure people’s socioeconomic emancipation. We will continue to extend our support to the Palestinian people. I reiterate Bangladesh’s unequivocal support for the two-State solution, based on the pre-1967 borders and the establishment of a Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital.
I shall now turn to the Rohingya people forcibly displaced from Myanmar. Last month marked five years since the 2017 start of the mass exodus of the Rohingyas to Bangladesh from their home country. Despite our bilateral engagements with Myanmar, trilateral discussions with partners and engagements with the United Nations and Member States, not a single Rohingya has been repatriated to her or his ancestral home in Myanmar. The ongoing political turmoil and armed conflicts in the country have made the repatriation of the displaced Rohingyas even more difficult. I hope the United Nations will play an effective role in that regard. The prolonged presence of the Rohingya in Bangladesh has had serious repercussions on our economy, environment, security and sociopolitical stability. Uncertainty over repatriation has led to widespread frustration. Cross-
border organized crime, including human and drug trafficking, is on the rise. This situation can even potentially fuel radicalization. If the problem persists further, it may affect the security and stability of the entire region and beyond.
The greatest lesson we learned from the COVID-19 pandemic is that no one is safe until everyone is safe. We must use the hard-earned lessons to stimulate the critical and much-needed reforms of our institutions, including of the United Nations, to better prepare for such calamities in the future. We are interested in looking for transformative solutions to alleviate poverty, mitigate the adverse effects of climate change, and prevent conflicts and the economic, energy and fuel crises that the world is grappling with now.
However, we need to understand the fact that socioeconomic development cannot be achieved without ensuring peace and stability. We want to see the end of the Russia-Ukraine war. Due to sanctions and counter-sanctions, all humankind, including women and children, is being punished. The war’s impact is not confined to one country; rather, it puts the lives and livelihoods of the people of all nations at greater risk and infringes their human rights. People are deprived of food, shelter, health care and education. Children suffer the most in particular. Their future sinks into darkness. I appeal to the conscience of the world to stop the arms race, war and sanctions; ensure food, education, health care and the security of the children; and establish peace. We want to see a peaceful world with enhanced cooperation and solidarity, shared prosperity and collective actions. We share one planet, and we owe it to our future generations to leave it in a better shape.
I would like to talk about a cruel tragedy now. On 15 August 1975, my father, the father of the nation, the incumbent President of Bangladesh Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was brutally assassinated, along with my mother Sheikh Fazilatunnesa Mujib, my three younger brothers, Freedom Fighter Captain Sheikh Kamal and his newly married wife Sultana, Freedom Fighter Lieutenant Sheikh Jamal and his newly married wife Parveen Rosy, and Sheikh Russell, who was just 10 years old. A total of 18 of my family members were killed, including my paternal uncle Freedom Fighter Sheikh Abu Naser, paternal uncle Abdur Rab Serniabat, his 13-year-old daughter Baby Serniabat, 10-year-old son Arif Serniabat and 4-year-old son Shukanto, my paternal cousin Freedom Fighter Sheikh Mani and his pregnant wife Arzu Mani, Brigadier Jamil, and police officer Siddiqur Rahman. May their souls rest in peace. My younger sister, Sheikh Rehana and myself survived the brutality on 15 August 1975, as we were in Germany at that time. After that, we spent six years abroad as refugees.
In 1971, when the liberation war going on, the Pakistan occupation forces killed 3 million innocent Bengalis. Two hundred thousand women were heinously tortured and abused. I recall their sacrifices with deep homage. After my father was arrested in 1971, he was taken to an undisclosed location in Pakistan. In Dhaka, my mother, my younger brothers Sheikh Russell and Sheikh Jamal, younger sister Sheikh Rehana and I were arrested, too, and were kept in a damp one-story house. My first child, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, was born in that prison house. There was no furniture in that house. There were no medical facilities or provisions. Even getting daily food was uncertain.
Having suffered these things myself, I can rightly realize the pain and agony that people endure due to the horrors of war, killings, coups and conflict. I therefore do not want war. I want peace. I want welfare for humankind. I want economic development for people. I want to ensure a peaceful world, and a developed and prosperous life for future generations. My earnest appeal to Member States is to stop war and the arms race. May the values of humankind be upheld. Let us join our hands together and build a better future, leaving no one behind, so that our future generations may live in a peaceful world.
Joy Bangla, Joy Bangabandhu. May Bangladesh live forever."
Belarus,BLR,Europe,"  9,453,000 ",18766,0.4810000062,5.2,74.59,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,2004,21.20,"  9,453,000 ",100.00,10.78,"For more than six months, the world has been living in the shadow of the conflict in Ukraine. It is adversely affecting a great many people on the planet. The conflict, like the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic that preceded it, has once again laid bare the downside of global interdependence.
This session provides a unique opportunity to take stock of the situation. Let us, in a very honest and unbiased manner, answer two questions. The answers to them, like the ensuing necessary action, is what all people around the globe expect from us, the United Nations Member States. The first is: What are the root causes of the conflict in Ukraine? The second is: What needs to be done to stop the conflict and prevent similar events from recurring in the future?
We are convinced that the conflict in Ukraine arises from a wider geopolitical chaos, whose causes must be sought in the events of 30 years ago. History teaches us that epoch-making wars that end in unfair and humiliating peace terms contain the seeds of future conflicts. Let us take a look at what kind of peace was established after the end of the last epochal confrontation — the Cold War.
The so-called winners, apparently influenced by euphoria, did not consider it necessary to draw on examples from the past. After all, they could have followed the path of Alexander I, Metternich and Castlereagh. Those great peacemakers of the early nineteenth century effectively integrated their adversaries into a new security system, thereby bringing lasting peace to Europe that would endure for decades to come. Likewise, they could have drawn inspiration from the model of cooperation established during the Second World War by the “Big Three” — Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill — who forged arrangements that significantly narrowed opportunities for great Powers to wage wars against each other.
Nonetheless, unfortunately, the Western policymakers of the early 1990s chose the most inglorious and unpromising option, namely, the path of the 1919-style Versailles diplomats eager to trample upon their main opponent. To begin with, the Cold War ended not even with an official treaty, but with some kind of gentlemen’s agreements and declarations. As subsequent events revealed, the so-called winning side did not respect those arrangements; in fact, they were nothing more than a Versailles 2.0.
The West revealed its selfishness by offering to the post-Soviet States only one path, that of being its satellites. To cement that status, the West relied on the expansion of one of its key Cold War-era institutions — the NATO military bloc. NATO’s eastward expansion occurred despite the agreements achieved with the West, including those struck with the Soviet leaders. The West overlooked the legitimate security interests of both Russia and Belarus.
In that regard, I recall the outstanding American diplomat George Kennan, whose foreign policy prophecies are so admired by Western policymakers. Why did they fail to heed another of Kennan’s famous warnings when, in 1996, he condemned NATO expansion as “a strategic blunder of potentially epic proportions”? With its drive to enlarge NATO, the West trampled upon the indivisibility of security, a vital principle according to which one party must not seek to achieve its own security at the expense of other parties. The peacemakers of 1815 and 1945 grasped that logic very well, whereas the world leaders of 1919 and 1991 refused to embrace it.
NATO’s involvement in the illegal wars against Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya and Syria, in addition to the Alliance’s attempts to encroach on some historical Eastern Slavic and adjacent lands made it a foregone conclusion that Versailles 2.0. would suffer the fate of the first Versailles. Therefore, it is the collective West that bears the full responsibility for the ongoing bloodshed in Ukraine. It was precisely the West that made the conflict inevitable, not only through its decision to expand NATO, but also by its refusal to consider the proposals of its opponents. After all, such proposals were made.
The questions arises: What should be done?
Indeed, in 2009 Russia invited all interested parties to sign a new European security treaty that would de jure wrap up the Cold War. The West rejected the proposal. In 2017, it was President of Belarus Alyaksandr Lukashenko who came up with the idea of holding a global security dialogue and proposed Minsk as a venue for negotiations. The opponents ignored that initiative as well. Last December, the Russian Federation made yet another attempt to reach an agreement with the West on the issue of European security. As before, the West remained deaf to the new Russian proposal.
What explains this rejectionist policy and stance of the West? The key problem is the ongoing clash at the global level between two incompatible visions of the world order — one concentric, the other polycentric. The West wants to establish a concentric or unipolar world, ruled from one centre and subordinated to the interests of a Western hegemon. Most other countries wish to create a polycentric or multipolar world with no single centre of control and in which no one imposes its visions, interests or values on anyone else. The West has dominated the world for the past five centuries, and believes that it can continue doing so indefinitely.
As for us, we are deeply convinced that the world has changed and that neocolonialism in any form is no longer an acceptable or viable option. Five centuries ago, when the West was just beginning its global ascent, the world came to witness the Copernican revolution of knowledge. That revolution took place, first and foremost, in the minds of the people of that time, who found it difficult to come to terms with the postulate that it was not the Earth but the Sun that stood at the centre of the solar system.
A similar Copernican paradigm shift must occur today. As was the case half a millennium ago, it too must take place in people’s minds. This time around, it must occur in the minds of the West’s political mainstream. The West must, at last, recognize a number of truths.
First, international relations do not revolve around one single — that is, Western — centre of power. Secondly, the world’s history has no end, because it is not an inexorable movement of all countries towards so-called liberal democracy. Thirdly, the world is too complex a structure to reduce all its problems to a confrontation — as we have also heard from this rostrum — between the so-called democracies and autocracies. That understanding, it would appear, has not yet registered with the West. What we have seen instead is the destruction stubbornly pursued by the West, including self-destruction.
Economic sanctions are almost the only tool in the West’s foreign policy toolkit. One cannot fail to sense that the very fact the sanctions have been imposed serves as an indicator of their effectiveness for Europe and the United States. In that regard, we are witnessing a substitution of concepts. The key objective has not been achieved, but the sanctions keep living a life of their own.
What common sense does the West invest in the unilateral, illegal economic sanctions it imposes against other countries? Without any trace of hesitation, the goal has been stated loud and clear — to achieve a change of power in various countries through food riots provoked by sanctions. This calculation has largely turned out to be a failure. Most countries have not joined the effort to implement the sanctions. Many States under sanctions, such as Belarus and Russia, are to a large extent self- sufficient. Importantly, the sanctions have given us a powerful impetus to develop hidden internal reserves and reinvigorate regional integration.
Undoubtedly, we will weather the storm. We will survive just as freedom-loving Cuba has been surviving illegal sanctions for more than six decades. Nonetheless, the sanctions have had two negative repercussions that their sponsors could hardly have anticipated.
First, they have reduced the supply of fertilizer and food from the countries under sanctions. As a result, those who suffer the most are the poorest people in developing countries. Suffice it to say, prices in those countries have skyrocketed by 300 per cent over the past half a year, while Africa is facing fertilizer shortages to the tune of over 2 million tons.
Secondly, funnily enough, the sanctions have had a boomerang effect, hitting the West itself. No matter how some may swagger today, ordinary people in Europe will, unfortunately, have to freeze through the coming winter. It is high time for Western countries to resort to common sense and return to dialogue and cooperation. Even in the current situation, Belarus stands ready to embrace dialogue and cooperation on equal terms, without preconditions or pressure.
Belarus, like many other countries, has spoken a great deal and everywhere about the conflict in Ukraine. We cannot do otherwise. The conflict is happening at our very doorstep. We are extremely saddened to see the fraternal Ukrainian people fall victim to the collective West’s geopolitical games. We are convinced that the origins of Ukraine’s now specific problems should be sought in 2004, when the West managed to carry out the first colour revolution in that country. The second revolution, a decade later, firmly secured Ukraine’s status as anti-Russian.
Instigated by the United States and its allies, Ukraine has been exterminating the people of Donbas for eight years for no other reason than that the local people want to speak their native language, Russian. But the West does not need Ukraine, neither as a member of NATO nor as a member of the European Union. Its new patrons are simply using it in their own great game against Russia. Today Ukraine is paying the price in blood because its politicians bought into that deception and disregarded the historical brotherhood of the three East Slavic peoples: Belarusians, Russians and Ukrainians. But it is never too late to admit and correct one’s mistakes.
For Belarus, which itself endured the genocide of the Belarusian people during the Second World War, when one in three people in our country was killed, it is unbearably painful to see the chaos in our neighbouring country and the suffering of ordinary Ukrainians. Ever since 2014, we have been making every possible effort to bring peace to Ukraine. It was our country in particular that became associated with peace in Donbas when the Minsk agreements were adopted in 2014 and 2015. Right after the outbreak of hostilities in Ukraine in February, it was the President of Belarus who managed to get the parties to the conflict to sit down at the negotiating table, once again on Belarusian soil. Belarus hosted three successful rounds of Ukrainian- Russian negotiations that opened real prospects for settling the conflict. Regrettably, that process has since stalled.
We remain deeply convinced that both a ceasefire agreement and a comprehensive strategic peace settlement around Ukraine, in a broad context of regional and global security, can be achieved only at the negotiating table. There is no alternative to talks. Otherwise, we will all get a new third Versailles. As a neighbour and an affected country, Belarus should be an integral part of the negotiation process and of final security guarantees.
We very much hope that the tragic events in Ukraine will compel the collective West to realize rather quickly that changes in international relations are irreversible. The sooner that happens, the sooner peace can come to Ukraine and other hot spots, and the sooner we can lay the foundation of a new, just world order. We believe that one crucial step in that process is a global security dialogue in the true spirit of San Francisco, whose urgency the President of Belarus clearly stated as far back as five years ago.
We have consistently highlighted the key role of the great Powers in this effort. Unfortunately, as we are seeing today, they hear and understand each other poorly. There is not the slightest hint that they are ready to move on from recriminations. Perhaps the time has come for the countries representing the developing world to collectively take the lead in global security with all of the energy and dynamism they displayed with great success nearly half a century ago in advancing the idea of a new international economic order. We believe that it is precisely now that the Non-Aligned Movement and the BRICS countries — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — as well as the regional integration unions, which are on the rise, must be directly and proactively involved in matters of global peace.
It is true that today, unfortunately, we do not have a clear concept for safeguarding the peace and security of our planet insofar because the world has become so complex that a multitude of diverse challenges defy any single framework. What is more, the mechanisms for neutralizing the global challenges that were put in place in the framework of prior geopolitical realities are lagging behind in making the decisions that would fit the times, or stalling altogether.
The task facing humankind today is to ensure that our civilization is not destroyed as we transition to a new multipolar world order. That is exactly what our common priority for action must be, including at the United Nations. It is in this direction, provided we want to survive at all, that we must seek consensus and promptly forge new, adequate response mechanisms.
It is for the sake of that objective that we must immediately silence the mutually destructive rhetoric and put an end to the fatal total confrontation that leaves no room for diplomatic efforts. That can be done only by responsible world leaders who, in the figurative expression of Henry Kissinger, “possess a sense of direction and mission”. Leaders with such qualities are bound to emerge on the world stage.
Our present state of mind was well captured by Martin Luther King Jr. more than half a century ago when he said:
“We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow
is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency
of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and
history, there ‘is’ such a thing as being too late.”
Let us act before it is too late.
Belarus, for its part, stands ready to play the role of a vigorously engaged and responsible stakeholder in security processes at the global and regional levels alike."
Belgium,BEL,Europe,"  11,482,000 ",39733,7.090000153,6.9,81.468,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,2111,18.39,"  11,482,000 ",100.00,11.18,"I want to begin with the story of Karina, 22-years-old.
Eight years ago, Karina — a teenager — was forced to flee Donetsk when Russia invaded eastern Ukraine. In spring this year, the family was once again forced to flee, but this time, Karina — now in her early twenties — did not follow her parents. For the first few days, she stayed in touch by phone, but soon things went quiet.
After the Russian barbarians retreated from Bucha, Karina’s horrible fate was revealed. Her body was found, and her stepfather shared with The Kyiv Independent what had happened to her:
“There were cuts and lacerations. There was a piece of flesh torn off from her ribs. Half of her
nails were torn off. Her leg was shot. They tortured
her and most likely raped her.”
These are haunting and horrifying words; and sadly, this is only one of thousands of stories that mark that we are living in one of the darkest moments since the birth of the United Nations. Out of the destruction and devastation of the Second World War, the United Nations emerged “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”, as the Preamble of the Charter of the United Nations begins.
Never again war in Europe — that was the mission. Never again were schools to be bombed on the European continent. Never again were hospitals to be hit. Never again were cities to be cut off from food and medicine. Today we are witnessing all of these in Ukraine. The mass graves and torture chambers in Izyum are the latest signs of the utter brutality of this unnecessary and illegal war — all gross violations of everything the United Nations stands for.
Faced with this Russian aggression and, indeed, war crimes, the United Nations is challenged to fulfil its calling. Everyone in this Hall, the representatives of every single country, will be asked one day: “What did you do to stop this? What did you do to protect the people of Ukraine? Did you look away, or did you act?” In this conflict, there is no room for neutrality.
It was the late Mikhail Gorbachev who said: “The victor is not the one who wins battles in a war, but the one who makes peace.” To win this peace, we must place the principles of the United Nations Charter at the forefront again — the principles of territorial integrity and national sovereignty. Indeed, if today the world is less stable and less secure, it is because of the sheer scandal that one of the founding Members of this United Nations has trampled on these principles and unleashed a war that reminds us of Europe’s darkest hours.
The statements of the past days and the threat to launch a nuclear war against an independent country have demonstrated Russia’s ruthlessness once again. It is reminiscent of medieval barbarism, much more than of Russian greatness.
We should be clear — this war will not go without consequences for those who are waging it. There will never be peace without accountability. That is why Belgium has always supported the International Criminal Court (ICC) and that is why we support the ICC in fully investigating and prosecuting all serious crimes committed in Ukraine. There is no room for impunity — not for the butchers of Bucha and definitely not for the leaders in Moscow who are calling the shots and bear the ultimate responsibility.
I specifically want to highlight the importance of the fight against sexual violence, one of the most destructive weapons of war, punishable under international law. Women who are exposed to acts of sexual violence suffer irreparable damage. And let us not forget that boys and men, too, are victims. They all deserve truth, justice and reparation.
This war is not just about Ukraine. It sows instability, famine and poverty all over the world. We have all seen the images of blocked Ukrainian ports, bombed grain silos and even looted Ukrainian grain. Those images speak for themselves of a chaos sown by Russia, and by Russia alone, that endangers the lives of hundreds of millions of people in Africa, Asia and Latin America — as if the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic were not enough.
In the midst of this chaos, the Black Sea Grain Initiative, signed in July in Istanbul, appeared as a beacon of hope. It showed the convening power of the United Nations, and I want to especially thank its Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Tiirkiye for making that agreement possible. I would also like to commend the positive role played by the African Union, whose leadership and mediation were decisive in the conclusion of the agreement.
We European countries have spared no effort in addressing this food crisis. We have maintained food exports. We are helping Ukraine through solidarity corridors, and we are providing emergency aid to the most vulnerable in the most affected regions. Belgium has considerably increased its humanitarian budget in recent years and will continue to work hand in hand with its humanitarian partners to meet the most urgent needs.
Yes, this food crisis forces us to look into the structural weaknesses of our agri-food systems. If we are to keep our promise and achieve zero hunger by 203 0 — our second Sustainable Development Goal — we must design sustainable and resilient food systems, systems that combine the traditional knowledge of local farmers with the scientific knowledge produced by research, and innovation.
Along with this food crisis, the Russian war is also causing a deep energy crisis with global fallout. People, also in Belgium, have difficulty paying their bills, small businesses are forced to pause because of spiking energy prices, and workers are losing their jobs. How should we deal with this?
First, we must continue to support our families and businesses. That is why the Belgian Government is releasing unprecedented support plans. After all we have done to cope with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, once again we stand ready to protect our people. We are not leaving anyone behind.
But that is only part of the answer. We should also be honest. We live in wartime and Governments by themselves will not be able to absorb the full weight of this war. I know that this is a tough message, but it is the only honest one. We will have to bear the weight of this war together, in solidarity.
Equally important is the action we take. We need to disconnect from unreliable energy suppliers. We must strengthen our energy independence, diversify energy supplies and transition faster to locally produced green and fossil-free energy. And that is what we are doing.
Belgium is one of the world leaders in offshore capacity and, with other European partners, we are investing to transform the North Sea into Europe’s biggest green power plant, quadrupling wind power in the North Sea. We are building a hydrogen hub in the heart of Europe for the import and transit of green hydrogen, and we are reaching out to partners in Africa and the Middle East to team up. Energy transition is a common challenge that needs common answers, from the North and the South. And we keep investing in nuclear energy, safer than today with less waste than today. If we want to bolster our energy independence and deliver on the promises of a green and sustainable world, we will need all of these.
Belgium brings innovative solutions and expertise to the table with universities and research centres that are world leading and that will help us to change and to adapt. It is this spirit, this can-do mentality, that we will take to twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
Last year in this Hall, I spoke about the deadly floods in my country (see A/76/PV.13). This year, along with many other countries, Belgium again suffered the effects of climate change and global warming, with persistent drought that endangered drinking water and destroyed crops.
War in Europe should not make us look away from the big challenges of our time — first and foremost, climate change. We cannot let one autocrat’s warmongering distract us from our common agenda, the Sustainable Development Goals — an agenda that has not become less relevant, but quite the opposite. Our generation faces a gigantic task, but I remain confident that with we will succeed.
To destroy progress, you only need one man. That is what we have learned this year. But to achieve progress, you need many hands. Never before, has cooperation — international cooperation — been so important. Regardless of all the obstacles, of all the pain and struggle, we have today perhaps the greatest opportunity humankind has ever had to create an inclusive community in which every citizen has a say and a stake — in which progress is attainable for all. Let us embrace this opportunity instead of destroying it with bombs and hatred.
This brings me to my final point, a fight close to my heart — the fight for human rights and liberal democracy.
On the eve of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we see human rights under increasing pressure. It is for that very reason that Belgium is running for a seat in the Human Rights Council for 2023-2025. Our candidacy reflects our commitment to multilateralism and our support for the international order based on the rule of law and on respect for human rights, without distinction.
A stronger focus on human rights is urgently needed. Let us take for example, women’s rights. After years of steady progress, we are fighting an uphill battle again. I am sickened to see the fate of women and girls in Afghanistan. What we all feared has become true. Despite all the promises, Afghan women and girls have been systematically excluded from public life over the past year. Girls are no longer allowed to go to school. They are forced to get married at an age when children should still be playing with their friends. Their mothers no longer allowed to go to work.
But as one young Afghan woman wrote, “I am heartbroken, but hopeful”. When this woman, whose rights are being crushed, does not give up then we too
must keep fighting, for going to school is not a privilege; it is a right of each and every child, of boys and girls. The Transforming Education Summit was a clear reminder that we must continue to fight for accessibility and quality of education for all, just as we must keep fighting for the right of women to equally participate in all domains of decision-making and public life. There will never be sustainable stability, let alone peace, when women are forced to take the back seat.
Not only human rights are under pressure; democracy itself is targeted. The Russian bombs and missiles directed towards the people of Ukraine are also aimed at causing conflicts in other countries. Just recently, it was exposed that Russia has spent $300 million to influence foreign officials; to replace their free will with Russia’s will; their own interests with Russia’s interests. This is a new form of colonization. In Africa, for example, ever more countries are becoming targets and victims, such as in the Sahel or in Central Africa. I want to make it clear to our partners that we will remain on their side. But is also happening also in Europe, where Putin is financing his puppets to carry out his agenda of division, mistrust and unrest, organizing disinformation campaigns, cyberattacks and illegal interference in free elections.
It should be clear — we will not back down on democratic principles and individual rights. We will not allow Russian trojan horses to undermine our democracies with disinformation and fear. When the fight for democracy is to be fought, we will and we shall stand up.
A founding Member of the United Nations, a permanent member of the Security Council, is waging a hybrid war on the international community. We cannot standby. We cannot look away. We must protect the people of Ukraine. We must do everything we can to help Ukraine win this war, and we will. We will also protect our own people, who are struggling to heat their homes and pay their bills. And we will work hand in hand with the Global South.
That is our mission today. For millions of people all over the world, the United Nations remains a beacon of hope, not least for the younger generations. Let us respond to their call and act. People are counting on us."

“At the beginning of my remarks, I would like to extend to Mr. Csaba Korosi my warm congratulations on his outstanding election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.
“I would also like to extend my congratulations to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, and his team for their remarkable work, carried out with competence and dedication, during their mandate, which deserves to be commended.
“Finally, I pay a warm tribute to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, with all my appreciation for the commendable efforts that he continues to deploy, alongside the Members, for the achievement of the noble objectives of our common Organization.
“The theme around which we gather this year, A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges’, is a pressing call to action. Indeed, this session is being held in a difficult international context, marked by the combined consequences of the coronavirus disease pandemic and the war in Ukraine, with their economic, political and social impacts on the whole world.
“In terms of peace and security, the first pillar of United Nations action and at the global level, action on our part, in the opinion of my delegation and in accordance with the position clearly expressed by the African Union, calls for imperative respect for international law and the territorial integrity and national sovereignty of Ukraine. We therefore urge the parties to the conflict to establish an immediate ceasefire and to open political negotiations without delay in order to save the world from the consequences of a planetary conflict.
“At the regional level, in this case in the area of West Africa to which Benin belongs, peace and security are threatened by the combined effects of the terrorist threat, on the one hand, and of maritime piracy, on the other, which constitute major obstacles to the free movement of persons and goods, as well as to the development of the nations concerned. Those obstacles, far from being purely regional issues, constitute a global threat and call for an immediate, coherent and integrated response from the community of nations.
“In terms of development, the second pillar of United Nations action, the time for diagnosis is long past, since we have already adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, whose articulations offer us a real plan of action for humankind and the planet in the immediate future and for posterity, in a more forward-looking approach.
“Aware of its own responsibilities, Africa, through the formulation and launch of a transformative vision for the continent, ‘The Africa We Want’, embodied by the African Union Agenda 2063, is resolutely committed to its economic integration and the acceleration of its industrialization, with added value and increased integration into global value chains. This means that the issue of Africa’s development, as one of the eight major priorities of the United Nations, must continue to be the subject of fruitful reflection, as was the case in July at the High-level Dialogue on Africa, organized jointly by the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council.
“However, in this decade of action, it is urgent that concrete and bold actions accompany the reflections so that solutions can be found to the concerns of the African continent. Benin, for its part, is resolutely committed to ensuring a common social minimum for all by tirelessly investing in the satisfaction of the vital needs of all its citizens, which are to dress decently, to eat properly, to be housed with dignity, to enjoy proper health care and to be educated in an appropriate way.
“To that end, and in addition to courageous reforms in terms of good governance and optimal mobilization of internal financial resources, the Government of Benin is investing in finding innovative sources for mobilizing the funds necessary for its development, through the successful issuance of special Sustainable Development Goals Euro bonds, for example. It is urgent that robust and appropriate support be provided to our countries, in support of their efforts, in order to consolidate and sustain the gains made, on the one hand, and to effectively meet the pending challenges, on the other.
“Development, if it is to be sustainable, requires, in addition to its economic and social components, an environmental component without which it cannot exist. That is why it is more than ever time to pursue our joint efforts to deal appropriately with the problem of climate change, which poses a real existential threat for Benin, due to the combined effects of desertification in the north, coastal erosion and the ongoing salinization of fresh water in the south, and the increasingly accentuated disruption of the cycle of the seasons throughout the national territory. In that context, Benin has great hopes for the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which will take place in November in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, and calls on the entire community of nations to hold fruitful discussions and achieve results that are commensurate with the stakes before and the restoration of hope.
“With regard to the promotion and protection of human rights, Benin, at the international level and thanks to the start this year of its mandate as a member of the Human Rights Council, contributes and will continue to contribute to actively promote and facilitate all initiatives contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, which is the most concrete way to guarantee respect for the rights of the human person.
“At the national level, Benin, among other actions, is investing in the mobilization, through various strategies, of resources to give the most vulnerable populations access to an adequate food system, high-quality education, health care that protects everyone, including the poorest, drinking water, electricity and clean energy.
“Faced with the multiple challenges that challenge us, the time is more than ever ripe for the need to preserve and even strengthen multilateralism and make it truly inclusive and based on rules that are fair and valid for all, as a crucible for reflection and action to provide viable and comprehensive solutions. In this context, Benin fully supports ongoing diplomatic initiatives within the United Nations to find peaceful, lasting and equitable solutions to the question of the creation of a viable Palestinian State endowed with the attributes of full international sovereignty and living in peaceful coexistence with the State of Israel; to efforts to find a definitive solution to the question of Western Sahara, capitalizing on the achievements of the political process, under the auspices of the Secretary-General, which is aimed at reaching a compromise solution, in the framework of the implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions; and to the question of the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed on Cuba, concerning which Benin associates itself with the declarations of the relevant summits of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, on the one hand, and with the resolution adopted at the thirty-fifth ordinary session of the African Union, held in February in Addis Ababa, on the other, to appeal to the need to end the said blockade in the name of the promotion of peace and development. Better still, we call for the normalization of relations between Cuba and the United States of America, which are two partners dear to Benin.
“As the Secretary-General underlines in his report entitled Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), the history of humankind, ancient and recent, demonstrates that it is capable of great things when it acts united and that we are now more than ever called upon to make a fateful choice between remaining passive and promoting the continuation of the ongoing disintegration, or acting resolutely to build a better, greener and safer future. I remain convinced that we will hear the voice of reason in favour of action for a better world.
“The theme of this session is fully relevant at a time rightly described as “decisive”, it invites us to find transformative solutions, in the face of interlocking challenges. That will be possible only through the engagement of multidimensional partnerships involving Governments, multilateral organizations, the private sector and civil society, with the common goal, in a spirit of shared responsibility, of taking bold action for the diligent implementation of existing agreements, in particular the effective achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.
“It is therefore with this call to responsible action, and with faith in our ability to work together to meet the challenges before us, that I wish full success to the work of the seventy-seventh session of General Assembly, pledging the readiness of my delegation to spare no effort to follow up, jointly with other members, on the commitments made in the context of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.
“Long live more solid, more inclusive and more coherent multilateral cooperation in the service of sustainable development!”"

May this seventy- seventh session allow us to continue strengthening multilateralism to more effectively confront the new and old threats that beset humankind.
Today, we are facing a multiple and systemic crisis of capitalism that increasingly endangers the life of humankind and the planet. There is no doubt that the challenges we are facing are becoming more complex every day. If we seek a better future for current and future generations, we must not only reflect on the economic, social, food, climate, energy, water and trade crises, but also clearly identify their origins so as to change a system that perpetuates the domination, exploitation and exclusion of the vast majority, generates the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few and prioritizes the production and reproduction of capital over the creation and reproduction of life.
At the same time that we face the multiple and systemic crisis of capitalism, we are witnessing the final chapter of the unipolar world. The construction of a new world order, which we hope will be for the benefit of all States and peoples of the world, is inevitable. Convinced that another world is possible, we in the Plurinational State of Bolivia propose the following.
First, we should declare the world a zone of peace. In that connection, we express our dismay at the considerable number of armed conflicts ravaging humankind, many of them promoted by transnational military corporations, as well as by the desire to impose a global political and economic order that benefits the interests of capitalism. Those conflicts have a great human cost and, in many cases, lead to the destruction of our cultural and environmental heritage.
Regardless of the origin, nature or geopolitical reasons for international tensions, the Plurinational State of Bolivia has been and will remain committed to a culture of dialogue among nations, through diplomacy among peoples. Unfortunately, however, we are seeing the growing deterioration of the multilateral system due to the capricious failure of the capitalist Powers to acquiesce to the existence of a multipolar world with a balance of power. Multilateralism is the only mechanism that represents a guarantee of respect among States, regardless of their economic or military power. We therefore believe that any breach of international peace and security is linked to the insufficient application of the mechanisms provided for in the Charter of the United Nations or, failing that, to their flagrant violation.
In 2014, the countries of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States declared the region a zone of peace. We committed ourselves to settling our disputes peacefully and banishing forever the use of force in the region. Along those lines, we call for the Assembly to be the space for a great historic agreement — an agreement in which dialogue and diplomacy prevail over any dispute — and for the world to also be declared a zone of peace.
To achieve that goal, it is vitally important, among several initiatives, for the United Nations to work tirelessly to achieve a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, for the historic rights of the people and State of Palestine to be respected, and for NATO to stop entertaining its expansionist plans.
Secondly, we should replace the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction with fair compensation to the world’s poor. It is precisely the lack of dialogue and measures of preventive diplomacy that has dragged us into an era of great tensions worldwide and of growing uncertainties and instability in global security. We are living in times in which there is a concentration of a large number of weapons of mass destruction in a small group of countries, which, by refusing to eliminate them and prioritizing their geopolitical interests, are endangering the peace and security of our planet.
Nine countries today have 12,705 nuclear warheads, 9,440 of which are in military stockpiles, ready to be used. Given this frightening reality facing the world, we must raise the banner of replacing military spending on the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction with the fair economic compensation that the main capitalist countries owe, morally and historically, to the countries of the periphery and the world’s poor countries.
Thirdly, we oppose the commodification of health care and favour universal health-care systems. In the past two years, our peoples have had to face not only uncertainty resulting from conflicts, but also a serious health crisis resulting from the coronavirus disease, which exposed the vulnerabilities and inequalities of health-care systems around the world, as well as of the financial system and the global economy.
In the face of health-care systems that benefit only those able to access private insurance, and in opposition to those who have turned health into a commodity, it is imperative to strengthen universal health-care systems in which the State meets its obligation to protect and guarantee collective rights, within the framework of the pre-eminence of economic, social and cultural human rights, thereby reducing the effects of the global economic crisis on the most vulnerable sectors of the population.
Fourthly, we need a global food sovereignty programme that is in harmony with Mother Earth. Another manifestation of the structural and multipronged crisis of capitalism is the food crisis, which is exacerbated by the effects of the pandemic, global geopolitical conflicts and the numerous environmental crises facing the planet. This situation has not only affected the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, but also threatens the most basic rights of millions of human beings.
According to the 2022 The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report, the number of people suffering from hunger in the world has increased dramatically over the past few years. In 2021 alone, a total of 828 million people, accounting for 9.8 per cent of the world’s population, were the victims of food insecurity. Asia, with 425 million people affected by the food crisis, and Africa, with 278 million affected, remain the regions hardest hit by the crisis. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the food crisis has affected more than 56 million people.
To address the food crisis, we must urgently implement a global food sovereignty programme that ensures better production conditions for small- scale farmers. That means access to seeds, fertilizer, technology, infrastructure, credit and private and community-based access of all kinds to markets. It also means better living conditions in their communities, in full harmony with Mother Earth.
Fifth, we must rebuild the productive and economic capacities of the countries of the periphery hard hit by the unrestrained logic of the concentration of capital. In addition to the impact of the coronavirus disease pandemic, which has degraded our economies and business transactions, today we are on an expansionary path, sustained by inflation, which has become a critical problem. For example, in August, the United States recorded annual inflation of 8.25 per cent, the highest in the past four decades, and there was unprecedented inflation rate of 9.1 per cent in the Eurozone. In addition, the war between Russia and Ukraine has exacerbated pressure on the price of energy, food, fertilizer, commodities and other products. In July this year, interannual inflation with respect to food reached double digits in some countries of Europe and in the United States.
In an interconnected world, it is important to respond to the needs of our peoples in the post-pandemic context by strengthening integration and cooperation, based on the principles of solidarity, complementarity and respect for the self-determination of peoples. In so doing, we can address the multidimensional effect on the economy and our industries, as well as on our productive capacities and self-sufficiency.
To that end, it is essential that we restructure the global financial architecture to ease the external debt burden globally so that developing countries have an opportunity to implement, in a sovereign manner, social policies with a focus on comprehensive and sustainable economic and social development. As always, the countries of the South are calling for balance in trade relations, as current trade relations continue to benefit only countries of the North.
In that regard, I would like to humbly share Bolivia’s experience. Following the restoration of democracy in 2020, thanks to the unity, struggle and conscience of our people, we returned to the path charted by our democratic and cultural revolution, dignity and sovereignty. We resumed the construction
of our plurinational State and the consolidation of our economic, social and community-based production model. It is a sovereign economic model. We have not accepted and will never accept measures that are imposed by the International Monetary Fund.
Our economic model reflects our political, economic, social and cultural reality and is based on the active role of the State in the economy, the nationalization of our strategic natural resources, the development of economic organization of all kinds, increased public investment, import substitution industrialization, the revitalization of the domestic market, product diversification, food security and sovereignty, income redistribution and the fight against poverty and inequality. In other words, we seek economic growth with social justice, inspired by our civilizing political objective to ensure that our people live comfortably, which has its origins in our indigenous roots.
Such responsible and sovereign policies have enabled us to return to the path of stability, economic growth and income redistribution. In the first quarter of 2022, economic activity increased by 4 per cent, fuelled by domestic demand. Our inflation rate stood at 1.6 per cent in August. Our economy has the lowest inflation rate in the region and one of the lowest in the world, compared to the inflation rates of various countries that, over the past 12 months, have exceeded double digits.
With regard to social development, in the second quarter of 2022 Bolivia recorded the lowest unemployment rate in the region — 4.5 per cent. International organizations, such as the Economic Commission for Latin America, have listed us as the country leading in poverty rate reduction in 2022, while poverty rates in other countries will increase. However, as with many other periphery countries, we continue to make herculean efforts to solve issues related to the multidimensional and systemic crisis affecting us, making our recovery increasingly challenging.
We deplore the fact that, while capitalist countries spend copious amounts of money on war, they make miniscule contributions to comprehensive sustainable development, decolonization, elimination of the patriarchy and the eradication of poverty and economic and social inequalities. One example is that in recent months, 20 times more financial resources were earmarked for the conflict in Eastern Europe than were pledged to the Green Climate Fund over the past decade. Peace is achieved not by buying and selling weapons, but rather by working together to build and, if necessary, rebuild the economic and productive capacities of all countries.
Sixth, the climate crisis requires accountability, solidarity and harmony between human beings and nature, not profit-seeking. Another crisis that threatens to destroy humankind and the integrity of our Mother Earth is the climate crisis, which is leading towards environmental collapse. The discouraging rates of emissions reductions that have been observed and estimated to date demonstrate that countries with the means to change their production and consumption patterns do not have the political will to do so. Those that have set ambitious targets for themselves have not received the means for implementation, as promised in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, to achieve those targets.
Furthermore, those that are mainly to blame for greenhouse gas emissions are now asking each country to chase the illusion of decarbonization by 2050, without considering the past responsibilities of developed countries or the capabilities and limitations of developing countries, for whom access to the latest clean technologies is out of reach. Perhaps the historic climate debtors want us all to be concerned only about the future so as to avoid, in the present, talking about the unfulfilled promises that were made to developing countries on funding, technology transfer and capacity-building.
The recent flooding in Pakistan, to whose people we offer our solidarity, serves as the most vivid and tangible example of the high human and material cost of the loss and damage caused by centuries of poor capitalist development. Today, more than ever before, it is clear that we need a specific financial mechanism that is based on solidarity, and not on profit-seeking, to address the losses and damage caused by the climate crisis in countries engaged in intense development of their productive forces.
We firmly believe that a future that is low in emissions and resilient to the climate crisis will not be possible if wealth remains concentrated in the hands of a few. Therefore, to reverse the climate crisis, we must resolve the economic, social and political contradictions that have been created by the capitalist model, as well as those human beings and nature.
Seventh, we must focus on the industrialization of lithium for the benefit of peoples and as a key pillar for the energy transition. I am referring to a strategic natural resource. Our country possesses the largest reserves of lithium in the world. We have managed this resource very responsibly, in particular as we take steps towards its industrialization, while ensuring that it is used to benefit all humankind as a key pillar of a global and just transition to a future that is low in emissions and respectful of Mother Earth.
We do not want our reserves of lithium to follow the path of other natural resources that, under conditions of colonialism and capitalist development, serve only to enrich a few and foment hunger among peoples. Bearing that in mind, we have consolidated our sovereignty over our natural resources, such as lithium. Its industrialization and benefits are for the well-being of peoples, not to enrich transnationals or a small, privileged group. We retain sovereign ownership of the economic surplus, which should be distributed among the lowest-income earners in the population.
We also reject interference or attempts of any kind to destabilize our country’s democracy with the goal of controlling our lithium. According to remarks by the commander of the United States Southern Command just a couple of months ago, the United States has the so-called lithium triangle, located in South America, formed by Bolivia, Argentina and Chile, in its sights. The United Nations must take measures against all those countries that do not respect sovereignty and the principle of non-interference and that challenge peoples to take control of their strategic natural resources. We are not pieces on a chessboard. We are peoples who work, day in and day out, to move ahead, and we have every right to make decisions about our natural resources.
Eighth, we must shift from nationalizing to regionalizing the fight against drug trafficking. We must change our approach to the fight against drug trafficking. We continue to focus only on supply and not on demand and that has served as a pretext for militarization and the waging of a global war on drugs. That has affected the farmers of the global South, while major criminal groups go unpunished, as they have never been publicly identified in the countries where drugs are consumed.
The global war against drugs criminalizes and leads to unilateral sanctions against countries of the South. However, it provides opportunities for asset-laundering, facilitates drug trafficking and other related crimes in the countries of the North. That cannot continue. Having enjoyed positive results in the fight against drug trafficking, Bolivia defends its model. We believe that the time has come to work with Peru, Colombia and other countries affected by the transit of drugs to regionalize the fight against drug trafficking, based on a comprehensive approach that is less militarized and more focused on economic and social issues. Here at the United Nations, we must work on a mechanism to assess results, not only in countries of the South, but also in countries of the North, one of which unilaterally endorses the war on drugs.
Ninth, we must strengthen international mechanisms offering preferential treatment to landlocked countries. Allow me to draw the Assembly’s attention to the law of the sea, which is now a major issue in international legal relations. All landlocked or isolated States have serious challenges in accessing the sea and taking advantage of its resources and marine areas have considerable development potential for countries, in particular developing countries.
All countries have the right of access and use of oceans, seas and marine resources, as stated in the Convention on the Law of the Sea. We must ensure a just distribution of rights and responsibilities with respect to marine resources, which play a decisive role for the future of the peoples of the world. The sea is a right of all peoples, and no one should be prevented from enjoying that right or using it for development purposes.
Therefore, guided by the principles of equality, non-discrimination, international solidarity and social justice to rectify imbalances and global injustice, we believe that it is important to strengthen international mechanisms to provide preferential treatment to States that have no sea coasts and are therefore at a severe geographical disadvantage with regard to taking advantage of marine resources.
It has been proven that landlocked countries are at a double disadvantage. It costs us more to import products and we face major obstacles in our development. In that regard, we must remind the international community that my country, Bolivia, was created with access to the sea, However, it is now a landlocked country, compelled by past circumstances to address various challenges in the areas of transport, communication and trade. We hope that, sooner rather than later, dialogue and diplomacy will triumph to right the injustices of a war imposed by capitalist interests and build a better future for kindred nations.
Tenth, we must enlarge our limited view of human rights and democracy. There is no doubt that democracy and human rights are inseparable. The Plurinational State of Bolivia experienced for itself that, when democracy is undermined, the very foundation for the enjoyment of human rights is also undermined. That is why we are most firmly committed to the decisions and actions taken by the Organization to protect the most vulnerable groups in our society.
Bolivia has decided to rebuild its institutions by incorporating the plurinational nature of our State, which means that our 36 indigenous peoples are an integral part of our State. A nation that is proud of its diverse identity can build a better country, based on its intercultural nature. Bolivian men and women know that. From the historical perspective, this has occurred in very short order and our challenge is to ensure that the transformation continues, with the goal of ensuring that everyone lives comfortably. We must expand our criteria for human rights in relation to democracy. Neither human rights nor democracy can exist if the privileges of the few are preserved at the cost of the economic, social and cultural rights of the majority.
Eleventh, concerning intergenerational solidarity, we firmly believe that the current vibrant and productive generation must show solidarity with those who have laid the foundation of our nations. We cannot ensure equality among generations if we do not consolidate equality among present generations. We are concerned about the overemphasis on future generations in the multilateral sphere without considering all the work done by the older people in our countries. We are concerned about the fact that, to date, there is no universal treaty that protects older people. We hope that in-depth reflection on this issue can take place at the Organization.
Twelfth, we must proclaim a decade of action for depatriarchalization in order to combat all forms of violence against women and girls. In the same vein, I would like to draw attention to a cause for alarm at the global level — the violence that continues against women and girls, particularly indigenous women and girls and those living in poverty. The pandemic and the structural crises of capitalism are degrading living conditions, especially for women in rural and urban areas, who continue to face complex and intersectional forms of violence.
The Gender Snapshot 2022 report issued by UN- Women and the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, which evaluates the annual progress on the nine targets of Sustainable Development Goal 5, points out that
“Gender discrimination has long relegated women and girls to positions subordinate to men in the workplace, politics and the home [...] and it will take at least another 21 years for laws to address and prevent violence against women to be in place everywhere and 286 years to secure gender equality in legal frameworks based on the current rate of change.”
The report also notes a worrisome setback in progress in poverty reduction and that rising prices are likely to exacerbate the trend. By the end of 2022, some 383 million women and girls will live in extreme poverty. Many other women in most parts of the world will not have an income sufficient to meet basic needs, such as food, clothing and adequate housing.
Mrs. Gonzalez Lopez (El Salvador), Vice-President, took the Chair.
Our Plurinational State of Bolivia has declared 2022 the year of the cultural revolution for depatriarchalization for a life free from violence against women. We are promoting policies aimed not only at strengthening regulatory frameworks, but also at tackling the structural causes of violence through education and strengthening women’s economic independence, as well as through cultural processes, in order to change the unfortunate reality created by the oldest system of oppression, the patriarchy, which sustains itself through colonialism and capitalism.
We call for the General Assembly to proclaim a decade of depatriarchalization. We refer to depatriarchalization because it is a complex process that requires community-wide political, economic, social and cultural change aimed at building reciprocal relationships for a life free from all forms of exclusion, dominance, exploitation, discrimination and violence for all of humankind and our Mother Earth.
Thirteenth, we must reject unilateral sanctions. It is inconceivable that in a world hit by crises and the pandemic that unilateral coercive measures are still being applied with the aim of breaking Governments at the expense of the hunger and suffering of their peoples. In the current global context, no country should be
persecuted, sanctioned or cornered for exercising its right to freely determine its own political, economic and social systems.
Putting Bolivia on a list of major drug transit or illicit drug-producing countries is one example of the unilateral actions that some countries have taken. The Plurinational State of Bolivia has a sovereign policy on combating drug trafficking that has yielded important results, and we reaffirm our Government’s commitment to strengthening the fight against that global scourge. However, it is clear that the war on drugs — primarily the one unleashed by the United States — has failed. That country therefore urgently needs to thoroughly consider changing its policies in view of the fact that it has become one of the major drug-consuming countries. Regrettably, during the previous administration, more than 100,000 people died of overdoses or drug addiction in the United States.
Another clear example of ongoing unilateral sanctions is the inhumane and criminal commercial and financial embargo against Cuba, which threatens the lives of millions of citizens. Maintaining such measures is a crime against humanity — not to mention that the United States designates Cuba as a State sponsor of terrorism. That unfortunate example should also give us pause to reflect on the fact that some countries do not comply with the majority of the decisions taken every year in the Assembly.
Finally, we must ensure the full application of the Charter of the United Nations and the principle of multilateralism. If we, the international community, cannot overcome the major problems we are facing, we will lead our peoples to a mass catastrophe. Fulfilling our responsibility to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Charter, as well as international law and the institutions it governs, is more crucial than ever. The multidirectional crisis the planet is suffering because of capitalist ambition — and we are far from overcoming it — will worsen if we do not take urgent measures. Only by strengthening multilateralism can we achieve greater dialogue and cooperation in seeking solutions to the crisis. Revitalizing multilateralism in earnest will allow us to restore the legitimacy of international law, ensure peace through social justice and reshape the fragile international order to make it pluralistic and solid.
Based on the experience it has accumulated since its democratic and cultural revolution in 2006, the Plurinational State of Bolivia is hopeful that we will overcome the current polarization in the global architecture — as well as the capitalist world order that has left us in a dizzying, dangerous, never-ending race of consumerism that threatens humankind and the planet — and build, in its place, a more just, inclusive and equitable world for all based on the principles of living well and people’s diplomacy."
Bosnia and Herzegovina,BIH,Europe,"  3,324,000 ",10576,25.56200027,5.9,77.262,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Diabetes,361,10.86,"  3,324,000 ",100.00,7.80,"As the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is my honour to address this organ.
I congratulate Mr. Shahid on successfully presiding over the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session. Despite the difficult working conditions caused by the pandemic, he worked with dedication with the Secretary-General, Mr. Guterres, so that this organ of the United Nations could carry out its duties. I also congratulate Mr. Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session. He can count on the support and cooperation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in ensuring the productive work of this organ.
At the recent sessions of the General Assembly and other international forums, we regularly assessed that the global order was experiencing tectonic changes. Today, however, we can conclude that the world has irreversibly changed. The international relations on which the security architecture of Europe used to rest, as well as the wider international framework, now do not exist.
At a time when towns and villages in Ukraine are facing the terrifying reality of war, the least that we can do is not to be silent about it. We must not be silent, particularly in this building, the home of the United Nations, established in order to prevent and stop what is currently happening in Ukraine. We must not be silent in Bosnia and Herzegovina either. We owe that to our vivid memories of the horrors of war and aggression.
The United Nations system was unable to prevent or stop the war in my country in the period between 1992 and 1995. Unfortunately, that happened again in the case of Ukraine. I am primarily referring to the Security Council, the organ responsible for safeguarding international peace and security, in the light of the principles set out in the Charter of the United Nations.
Due to internal relations and barriers, the Security Council is clearly unable to fulfil its obligations. However, the General Assembly adopted a resolution on aggression against Ukraine (resolution ES-11/1) by an overwhelming majority. That resolution affirmed the undisputed principles of the Charter of the United Nations and other acts of international law, which prohibit the use of armed force. It orders States to resolve disagreements by peaceful means. The resolution expresses support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. It unequivocally refers to the actions of the Russian Federation as aggression. It calls for the aggression to stop. Finally, it rejects the secessionist moves of certain regions within Ukraine directed against its territorial integrity.
Bosnia and Herzegovina supported that resolution and stood on the right side of history, along with 140 other countries. That is in line with the obligations arising from the United Nations Charter, our previously held positions and our obligation, in accordance with the Stabilization and Association Agreement, to follow the foreign policy of the European Union.
Although the resolution does not have the power to stop the war, it has the power to stop the lies. The clear and unambiguous language of this highest international forum drastically reduces the space for those who try to relativize the truth. The first step towards any solution is to tell and respect the truth.
I hope that there will be peace as soon as possible so that people in Ukraine can live normal lives and the displaced can return to their homes
The war in Ukraine, as well as the consequences of the pandemic, led to drastic changes in all spheres of life. That is currently clearly visible in the serious energy crisis, inflation, a general recession and the threat to supplies, especially in the food sector. We are all facing a very difficult and challenging winter.
Global markets and international free trade enabled enormous progress in all corners of the world. The eradication of hunger, the availability of consumer goods and the continuous economic growth in all parts of the world are all unquestionable benefits of
global economic liberalization. Globalization tightly connected the various parts of the world and made us interdependent. Strong economic, security and political interrelations produced an increasingly integrated global framework. Within that framework, everyone relies on each another in various areas, from the economy to security.
At the same time, the interdependence of the different parts of the world is the source of the vulnerability of our global community. That became obvious during the pandemic, when transportation and supply channels were blocked. It is also obvious in the light of the current crisis related to the war in Ukraine. Due to the blockade of wheat exports from Ukrainian ports, developing countries in Africa and Asia are facing hunger. A large part of the European continent is facing an energy crisis due to dependence on Russian gas.
As a result of difficulties caused by the process of political and economic integration, in recent years we have often witnessed strong advocacy for political sovereignty and economic protectionism. The consequences of the transformation of developed countries from industrial to post-industrial nations, migration and, most recently, the pandemic led many to call for the construction of economic barriers, and even actual walls and wire fences.
That is the wrong path to take. The answer to the above problems is not to close up, but to open up. The solution is not less, but more, cooperation. The answer to the energy crisis in Europe, caused by dependence on a single source, is relying not only on one’s own forces. The answer lies in diversification and in finding new, multiple channels of gas supply and other energy sources.
No one in the modern world has enough resources to be self-sustainable. Past crises show that dependence on individual external sources is not sufficient either. We can overcome such difficulties only by increasing our international cooperation.
We live in unstable times, unprecedented in recent history. As we face an extremely difficult winter, we are aware of the destabilizing potential of the current economic and energy crisis.
The twentieth century provided extremely valuable lessons about the correlation between an economic crisis and right-wing populism. The Nazi movement came to power on the wave of a great economic depression. That led to the greatest cataclysm in the history of humankind. Following that, the United Nations was established and the United Nations Charter, as well as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and other United Nations acts, were adopted.
The fundamental idea of the United Nations is that of the equality of all people, regardless of their origin, skin colour, religion and national or other affiliation. All the acts of international law I mentioned are based on that idea. Modern civilization was built on that idea.
Today, almost eight decades later, we can hear voices openly or implicitly denying those basic tenets. Right-wing populists increasingly say that all people and nations do not have equal rights and that some are more valuable than others. It is becoming increasingly frequent that they openly advocate the ideas of ethnic and racial supremacy and claim that domination and brute force are the only principles on which interpersonal and international relations can, and should, be structured. It takes only one step from those ideas to violence.
From this rostrum, from the United Nations building, I call for caution and action. We will face enormous challenges in the coming period. We must fulfil our duty and fight for the ideas of civilization. We must defend those ideas at all costs.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has been home to many peoples, cultures and religions for centuries. Our long tradition of multiculturalism is something in which we take pride. We are proud of our Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Roma and other communities, as well as the culture of living together and mutual respect that we have developed over the centuries. All those communities, individually and collectively, make up the structure of the mosaic of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina. That is the way things are, and that is how things will remain.
At the same time, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a meeting place of cultures, was a thorn in the side of policies based on the idea of the impossibility of living together and the necessity of confrontation. Such policies led to the terrifying war in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995. That war culminated in the genocide in Srebrenica.
The resolutions from that period adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council, as well as
the reports of the Secretary-General and the judgments of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, recognize the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina as an international armed conflict, in which neighbouring countries participated.
The judgments handed down by the International Tribunal in the The Hague conclude that joint criminal enterprises took place. The goal of those enterprises was the elimination of certain ethnic groups from parts of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina so that those territories would ultimately be annexed to neighbouring countries. That was the most serious violation of international general and humanitarian law.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has undergone an arduous peacebuilding process since the conclusion of the Dayton Peace Agreement. However, we still face numerous challenges. Some of the major challenges are certain policies in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the neighbourhood that have never abandoned the war-time goals of dividing our country.
There are parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina that are part of the broad wave of right-wing populism in Europe. They openly claim that Bosnia and Herzegovina is not sustainable because, according to them, it is not possible for Muslims and Christians to live together. Muslims and Christians live, and can live, together. Such a way of living has a perspective. What certainly has no perspective are retrograde policies that oppose that way of living
Bosnia and Herzegovina has a centuries-old history and is a living example and proof of the civilizational idea that people of different religions, nations and cultures can live together. The fact is that Bosnia and Herzegovina, even despite the war aimed at its destruction, managed to survive. That shows the exceptional resilience of my country.
The majority of people in Bosnia and Herzegovina want to live in peace with their differences. There is sufficient strength for such a Bosnia and Herzegovina to persevere. I am convinced that that will be the case.
The experience of Bosnia and Herzegovina shows that the rule of law is a crucial factor in peacebuilding. The International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, formed by the United Nations, granted the victims the minimum of justice. It sent a message to criminals that their actions would not go unpunished, and that they would be brought to justice and face the consequences for their actions.
Moreover, there were other international community bodies that made a huge contribution to the building and safeguarding of peace, primarily the Office of the High Representative for the Implementation of the Peace Agreement on Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Peace Implementation Council.
Both those bodies were established on the basis of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, which mandates the intervention of the international community in order to maintain peace. The establishment of those bodies was also upheld by the relevant Security Council resolutions. Consequently, the closure of those bodies is possible only following a new decision of the Security Council. It is not yet time for that.
Allow me to remind Member States of the international supervision that was present in some significantly developed countries, such as Germany, with even greater executive powers than the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina. That supervision was ended after 45 years of existence, only once the necessary prerequisites for that had been created.
The Office of the High Representative and the Peace Implementation Council have been helping domestic political actors to implement reforms for the past 27 years. Through joint efforts, we managed to unite the three once-warring armies into a single armed force. We also united the three intelligence services, tax systems, judiciaries, et cetera.
Thanks to those reforms and the existence of the armed forces and other State institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, even after the gradual withdrawal of 60,000 international troops from Bosnia and Herzegovina, the peace remained intact.
The past year brought attacks against the 27 years of implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement. In particular, there was an attempt to disband State institutions established on the basis of the clear provisions of the Dayton Peace Agreement.
Thanks to the action of the Office of the High Representative and the Peace Implementation Council, Member States, led by the United States of America, the attack on State institutions was stopped and peace was once again preserved. That demonstrated
the expediency and efficiency of the international community institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
There were requests for the closure of the Office of the High Representative in the past. More recently, there have been frequent requests that the High Representative take steps that would weaken the unity of Bosnia and Herzegovina and introduce additional ethnic divisions. In accordance with the Dayton Peace Agreement and the United Nations Charter, it is the obligation of the High Representative to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and not to contribute to its disintegration.
In addition to the civilian international presence in the country, there is also an international military presence in the country, specifically the European Union Military Operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina (EUFOR-Althea) and the NATO headquarters, with a total of 1,100 troops. In that regard, Bosnia and Herzegovina is not special. Many more developed sovereign States need the presence of international military forces in much larger numbers than is the case in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The international military presence was established by the Dayton Peace Agreement. The Security Council reaffirms the mandate of the EUFOR-Althea mission on an annual basis. The Security Council will vote on the EUFOR-Althea mandate again in less than a month. It is very important for the stability of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region that the draft resolution be adopted. However, it is important to emphasize that in any case, in accordance with the Dayton Peace Agreement, NATO has the right and obligation to deploy its forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Also, the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina took decisions in the past that gave consent for the presence of EUFOR-Althea and NATO forces without any time limits. Those decisions are a sufficient legal basis for the presence of an international military mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina until the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina takes a different position.
Bosnia and Herzegovina’s foreign policy goals are membership of the European Union (EU) and NATO. The June 2022 session of the European Council opened up the space for granting Bosnia and Herzegovina the status of a candidate for membership of the European Union if certain conditions are met. Bosnia and Herzegovina has recently made specific progress in terms of fulfilling the 14 priorities defined in the opinion of the European Commission on Bosnia and Herzegovina’s application for EU membership. We have fulfilled some of the said priorities in full and some partially, including, I am pleased to say, over the past few weeks.
I expect that we will continue making even more progress after the general elections scheduled to be held next month on 2 October. I also expect Bosnia and Herzegovina to be granted EU membership candidate status as soon as possible.
Regarding our relations with NATO, Bosnia and Herzegovina is part of the membership action plan. In order to undertake the reforms that NATO expects from us as a potential candidate country, the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina adopted its reform programme, which is our annual obligation.
Regional cooperation is one of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s foreign policy goals. We want good relations with our neighbours, based on mutual appreciation and respect under the principle of reciprocity. That is the only way to build relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina. Everyone in our region must understand that the geostrategic and geopolitical configuration of the region is complete. The path to security and prosperity is the path of mutual cooperation and solving current issues, in accordance with the principles of international law. We are all equal in the region. No one can dominate anyone else. We all need peace and stability.
The whole world needs peace and stability. All ongoing disputes in the world should be resolved in accordance with the principles of international law, with the involvement of the international judicial institutions. That is why it is very important to strengthen multilateral mechanisms and institutions. I therefore believe that the strength and authority of the United Nations as a key multilateral mechanism must be enhanced."
Botswana,BWA,Africa,"  2,254,000 ",15015,17.35700035,3.5,69.275,HIV/AIDS,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,370,16.42,"  1,622,762 ",71.99,5.08,"At the outset, I wish to extend my sincere congratulations to Mr. Csaba Korosi and his country, Hungary, on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session. I am certain that this organ will benefit greatly from the wealth of knowledge and experience he has acquired during his illustrious career in the diplomatic service, including his term here in New York as Hungary’s Permanent Representative, when he co-chaired the intergovernmental process and ushered in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
I must particularly express gratitude to the outgoing President for his close coordination and collaboration with other principal organs, particularly the Economic and Social Council, which Botswana was honoured to lead as its seventy-seventh President. I am delighted that the two Presidents worked very cooperatively on addressing vaccine equity, the sustainable development of Africa, financing for sustainable recovery and the nexus between natural resources and sustainable development, among other priorities. Close collaboration among principal organs of the United Nations is beneficial and must be promoted.
Botswana endorses Mr. Korosi’s choice of the theme for this session, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”. We concur with his observation that the current global challenges —namely, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the war in Ukraine, humanitarian challenges and climate change — are complex and interconnected and hence require transformative solutions. Given the interconnectedness of those challenges, it is evident that they can be effectively addressed only with a holistic approach. That further demonstrates the enduring relevance of the Charter of the United Nations, which 77 years ago established the three founding pillars of the United Nations system — human rights, peace and security, and development — as interrelated and mutually reinforcing.
As United Nations Member States, we should look no further for those solutions than in the already existing key multilateral frameworks, among them the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its SDGs, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the Declaration on the commemoration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations (resolution 75/1), as well as the outcomes of major United Nations meetings. This session gives us an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to those solutions. In his comprehensive report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), the Secretary-General has offered us a boost with concrete ideas and recommendations to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and to close the existing gaps in our multilateral frameworks.
I wish therefore to preface my remarks, through which I will share my country’s progress in recovering from COVID-19 and moving towards a transformative and sustainable development, by reminding the Assembly of Botswana’s road to development. Many in this Hall may only know the Botswana of now, which is an upper-middle-income country. That is a status that we are proud of, given that when we attained our independence, only 56 years ago, we were among the poorest in the world. However, we were fortunate to discover what has turned out to be the world’s largest diamond reserve across the Kimberley Belt.
For those less acquainted with the development path we have travelled as a country, that is not the entire reflection of the Botswana story. Our story is based on the humanity, principles and tenacity that we have as a people, as Botswana. It is a story of the wisdom of our forefathers, who avoided the misfortune that often accompanied the discovery and exploitation of minerals in other parts of the world and elected instead to turn the discovery of diamonds into a story for development. Botswana is a nation that would never have been able to realize its development had we not held firmly to our belief in the principles of democracy, centred on the rule of law, good governance and the protection and enjoyment of basic human rights by our people.
However, I must admit that we face an uphill battle in our investment efforts to attract investors to help us diversify our economy away from dependence on diamonds. I have stood before the General Assembly and I have engaged in different forums, when the opportunity arises, to share the Botswana story with a view to encouraging partnerships to augment our efforts towards diversification. I trust that those who are attentive to our call are more in number, and I firmly believe that they, too, aspire to share a part of our story.
In the meantime, diamonds are still the bedrock of our economy. It is in that respect that the words of
Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the call for a common agenda resonate with me. I like in particular the call by the Secretary-General for a global view whereby power, wealth and opportunity are shared more broadly and fairly at the international level. For my country, that translates into a fair and equitable opportunity to use the resources that we have to develop our people and give them an equal opportunity to contribute and share in global wealth. As we continue to advocate for the Kimberley Process, I wish to remind the Assembly that Botswana’s story is unquestionable proof and living testimony that diamonds, with good governance, are for development. In fact, diamonds are a serious matter of livelihoods. I will be hosting a side event on diamonds for development later this evening, through which I hope to further broaden conversations and allow our partners within the United Nations, Governments, civil society and the private sector to join us in ensuring that my country, Botswana, will also be part of the United Nations family, espoused around shared power, wealth and opportunity, as we endeavour to realize the 2030 Agenda.
Despite our challenges, my Government continues to play its part in contributing to the international agenda and ensuring that our peoples’ access to medicines is part and parcel of their health care, while ensuring that the economy also recovers from the pandemic. Vaccine roll-out remains a precondition for a sustainable recovery, yet many countries in the global South, especially in Africa, have not met the World Health Organization target of full vaccination of 70 per cent of the population by mid-2022. That underscores the urgent need to continue promoting vaccine equity through international solidarity and addressing vaccine hesitancy by countering disinformation and raising awareness about the science-backed facts regarding the effectiveness and safety of the vaccines.
Despite the challenges that we have encountered, which are common to many developing countries, Botswana has procured enough vaccines to administer to all eligible groups, thus enabling significant progress, with 64 per cent of our population now fully vaccinated. However, much more needs to be done. It is in that context that Botswana continues to play an active role in that matter and recently also joined other Member States in co-sponsoring resolution 76/301, calling for the convening of a high-level meeting on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response during the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly. We also continue to actively participate in the ongoing process towards a possible elaboration of a pandemic treaty at the World Health Organization in Geneva. We believe that such a legally binding instrument would strengthen existing global mechanisms to address and react more speedily to health emergencies.
I am pleased to inform the Assembly that, as part of overcoming the challenges of global vaccine inequity and in line with our commitment to building back better and in a transformative manner, the Government of Botswana has approved the manufacturing of the patent-free CorbeVax COVID-19 vaccine and that the construction of a vaccine manufacturing plant has already commenced. Additionally, the facility will produce cancer treatment and next-generation, cell- based immunotherapy. Those initiatives have been undertaken in partnership with NantWorks, Texas Children’s Hospital Centre for Vaccine Development and Baylor College of Medicine. That partnership will enhance Botswana’s capacity in human vaccine production, contribute to our goal of building a knowledge-based economy and help in preparations for future pandemics.
Botswana’s recovery plans include strengthening the country’s vast social protection system to ensure the inclusivity of vulnerable groups, including persons living with disabilities. That will go a long way towards facilitating equal enjoyment of their rights while broadening the accountability framework as we recently acceded to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In that regard, my Government has set a medium- to long-term economic recovery and transformation plan intended to fast track recovery efforts while advancing the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its goals. In order to achieve sustainable development, adequate financing is needed for the success of our recovery efforts from the pandemic and acceleration of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda during this Decade of Action. The effective mobilization of domestic and international financial resources, as well as their prudent utilization, are therefore imperative. I therefore reiterate calls on development partners to scale up and fulfil our official development assistance commitments and our efforts to attain long-term development sustainability.
In addition to international funding, it should be noted that transformative agendas require the effective implementation by Governments and associated stakeholders, as well as a sense of ownership on the
part of all stakeholders and a buy-in from the people we serve. This decisive moment of the myriad challenges we face demands that we challenge ourselves even more. My Government has thus initiated its recent agenda, inspired by the need for collective, inclusive and coordinated efforts towards the transformative agenda. We are accelerating digitalization in the delivery of services, driven by innovation and creativity. Our people are responding to the technology-driven solutions and they, too, are demonstrating the reorientation of their disposition, as well as conceptual agility to venture into new frontiers of doing things differently. A full embrace of this mindset change is an inspirational approach to the effective implementation of Government policies, programmes, projects, business activities and, indeed, the Sustainable Development Goals.
The realization of transformative solutions to the current social and economic challenges will require solidarity, both within and among countries. As Chair of the Group of Landlocked Developing Countries, many of which are also characterized as least-developed and small States, Botswana expresses solidarity with fellow United Nations Member States in special situations, particularly the distinct and peculiar challenges faced by the least developed countries and the small island developing States in their efforts to build back better and recover sustainably from the pandemic.
In line with the repeated position of our subregional body, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), I also wish to express solidarity with our northeastern neighbour, Zimbabwe, and call for the removal of unilateral coercive measures targeted at that country. While we are confident of the resilience and resolve of Zimbabwe and its economic transformation prospects, we are concerned that such measures are not advancing the cause of livelihoods of innocent Zimbabweans or the cause of our SDGs.
This year, we continue to witness extreme weather events that point to the escalating severity of the climate crisis. The decisive implementation of the bold climate action spelled out in the Paris Agreement and the Glasgow Climate Pact is therefore needed to prevent the worst implications. Botswana remains committed to our 15-per cent carbon emissions reduction target by 2030, as indicated in our nationally determined contributions and reconfirmed in our climate change policy, adopted in 2021. The policy addresses access to climate finance, clean technologies and renewable energy.
Climate ambitions will not translate into climate action in developing countries if they remain inadequately funded. We are therefore pleased that new financial pledges to support adaptation in developing countries were made at the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP) in Glasgow, United Kingdom. It is our hope that these commitments will be fulfilled expeditiously in order to enable accelerated implementation, particularly in Africa, a region that contributes minimally to climate change but is, regrettably, the most affected. In that context, we are optimistic that COP27, to be held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, on African soil, will further inspire ambitious climate action and deliver more adaptation resources for Africa and other vulnerable regions.
Drawing on that inspiration, Botswana, in collaboration with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and various stakeholders, convened a climate adaptation week 2022 from 22 to 26 August in Gaborone, under the theme “Transformations in Advancing the Formulations and Implementation of National Adaptation Plans”. The expo succeeded in promoting the exchange of experiences and fostering partnerships among a wide range of actors and stakeholders on how to advance national adaptation plans.
On 2 March, Botswana was among the 141 Member States that voted in favour of resolution ES- 11/1, demanding an end to the invasion of Ukraine. With that vote, we were reaffirming the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, particularly its Articles 1 and 2, which underscore the need for peaceful settlement of disputes, as well as respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Charter is a binding instrument of international law; therefore, all peace-loving nations ought to adhere to its letter and spirit under all circumstances. We therefore continue to call on all parties to recommit to finding peaceful and lasting solutions to the conflict through diplomacy and dialogue. The United Nations-brokered talks that resulted in the Russian Federation and Ukraine signing an agreement on the Black Sea Grain Initiative are a testament to the fact that, when given a chance, diplomacy and dialogue can yield results. If nothing else, the end of the Second World War and the founding of the United Nations in 1945 demonstrated that only if we approach conflict based on solidarity and working together can we find peace.
I commend the Secretary-General and the United Nations system organizations, Tiirkiye and other stakeholders, including such neighbouring countries as Poland, for rising to the challenges to address humanitarian needs in Ukraine and other crisis situations. As we continue to seek an amicable redress of this warring conflict, it is important that the United Nations system be particularly adequately resourced, given its critical work of saving lives and alleviating the suffering of victims of armed conflict, climate change and other disasters.
We, the collective States Members of the United Nations, have the responsibility and mandate to strengthen international law, promote human rights and gender equality and, most crucial, to protect civilians in challenging peacekeeping environments. In that context, Botswana shares the same ideals with many States represented here today on the principle of the responsibility to protect. As already acknowledged at the 2005 World Summit, States have the primary responsibility to protect their own populations from genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes and crimes against humanity. As part of the Group of Friends of the Responsibility to Protect, Botswana as co-Chair, together with Costa Rica and Denmark, and will continue to ensure that the membership of the United Nations pays attention to this important responsibility to reinforce global action.
In southern Africa, we remain actively engaged through our subregional organization, SADC, in addressing the threat posed by terrorism and violent extremism to peace and security in our subregion. To that end, SADC has deployed its security forces to thwart terrorist threats in the Cabo Delgado province of Mozambique.
The United Nations response to today’s crises is a clear demonstration of its indispensability as the foremost organization in addressing global issues. From its system-wide response to COVID-19 to its swift action in relation to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and other crisis situations, the United Nations has proven to be fit for purpose. Nonetheless, there remains ample room for improving the Organization’s effectiveness in fulfilling the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. In that connection, we welcome recent reforms and proposals aimed at strengthening the United Nations system and enhancing its relevance in addressing contemporary challenges. These efforts include the Secretary-General’s development management, peace and security, human rights and humanitarian pillar reforms, which are aimed at enhancing the Secretariat’s ability, agility, accountability and effectiveness in mandate implementation.
For a small country like mine, the reform of the United Nations is important only insofar as it ensures the equal voice of Member States, regardless of their size. My Government and I personally are therefore eager to have our own people represented and employed within the United Nations system. With our presidency of the Economic and Social Council, I believe that Botswana has demonstrated its ability, including the capacity of our youth, who have received positive reviews for their support to the Secretariat of the Economic and Social Council during our tenure. We are, however, eager to see such accolades turning into real opportunities for absorption through other employment opportunities and in the hierarchy of the Organization, particularly for our youth.
As I conclude my remarks, let me reassure the President that he can count on Botswana’s support and constructive engagement towards a successful implementation of the programme of work of the seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly. I hope that Botswana can also rely on the United Nations system and our development partners and the wider international community to help us realize the 2030 Agenda and transform our people and country into a developed nation by 2036."
Brazil,BRA,South America,"  209,468,992 ",13479,13.31999969,6.2,75.672,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Lower Respiratory Infection,14540,6.94,"  209,468,992 ",100.00,7.87,"I would like to greet the Secretary-General, whom I have the renewed pleasure of addressing in our common language.
I begin by congratulating you, Ambassador Csaba Korosi, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session. You can count on the support of Brazil.
The theme chosen for this general debate revolves around a concept that perfectly applies to the moment we live in: a watershed. Our collective responsibility in the General Assembly is to understand the scope of the challenges that make up this watershed moment and, from there, to build responses that pull their strength from the objectives shared by us all. The task is not simple. But strictly speaking, we have no alternative. The effort must begin within each of our countries. First of all, it is what we do at the domestic level that gives the measure of the authority with which we act at the international level.
Allow me to speak from my country’s perspective. When Brazil expresses its positions on the public health agenda, we do so with the authority of a Government that, during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, spared no effort to save lives and preserve jobs. Like many other countries, we focused our attention from the very beginning on ensuring emergency financial assistance to those most in need. Our goal was to protect families’ income so that they could face the economic hardships resulting from the pandemic. We helped more than 68 million people, the equivalent of one third of our population. In tandem, we launched a broad vaccination programme, including the domestic production of vaccines. We are a nation of more than 210 million people, and already more than 80 per cent of the population has been vaccinated against COVID-19. All were vaccinated voluntarily, in full respect of each person’s freedom of choice.
Likewise, economically Brazil has the authority of a country that, for the sake of sustainable and inclusive growth, has been implementing reforms to attract investment and improve the living conditions of its population.
During my Administration, we uprooted the systemic corruption that existed in the country. Between 2003 and 2015 alone, the period in which the left presided in Brazil, the debt level of Petrobras due to poor management, politically driven appointments and favours, as well as the diversion of funds, reached $170 billion. The person responsible was convicted unanimously in three court cases. Whistle-blowers returned $1 billion, and we paid the United States stock market another $1 billion due to losses incurred by shareholders. But that is the Brazil of the past.
We upgraded public services by reducing costs and investing in science and technology. Nowadays, for instance, Brazil is the seventh most digitally advanced country in the world, with 135 million people accessing 4,900 services provided by my Administration. Brazil was a pioneer in the deployment of 5G in Latin America.
We implemented a comprehensive agenda of privatizations and concessions, with an emphasis on infrastructure. We have concluded the Transfer of the Sao Francisco River project, bringing water to the Brazilian north-east. We adopted new regulatory frameworks, such as in basic sanitation, railroads and natural gas. Moreover, we improved the business environment, with the economic freedom law and the start-up law. As a result, we created opportunities for young people to be entrepreneurs and have quality jobs. Crowning all those efforts to modernize the Brazilian economy, we are making great strides towards Brazil’s entry as a full member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Despite the global crisis, Brazil is reaching the end of 2022 with an economy in full recovery. We have high employment and a low inflation rate. The economy is growing again. Poverty increased across the world as a result of the pandemic. In Brazil, it has already begun to fall sharply.
The figures speak for themselves. It is estimated that, by the end of 2022, 4 per cent of Brazilian families will be living below the extreme poverty line. In 2019, it was 5.1 per cent. That represents a drop of more than 20 per cent. Auxilio Brasil, the minimum-income programme established by my Administration during the pandemic, which reaches 20 million families, pays them almost $4 a day.
Unemployment fell by 5 percentage points, reaching 9 per cent — a rate not seen for seven years. We reduced inflation to an estimated 6 per cent this year. I am pleased to announce that we had unprecedented deflation in Brazil in the months of July and August. Since June, the price of gasoline has dropped by more than 30 per cent. Today a litre of gasoline in Brazil costs about $0.90. The price of electricity also fell by more than 15 per cent. Let me stress that the cost of energy did not drop because of price-fixing or any other type of State intervention. It was the result of a tax-rationalization policy formulated and implemented with the support of the National Congress of Brazil.
In 2021, Brazil was the fourth-largest destination for foreign direct investment in the world. Our foreign trade reached the historic milestone of 39 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), even after reducing taxes or lowering them to zero on thousands of products. Domestically, we are also breaking records in three areas — tax collection, State-owned company profits and the public debt-to-GDP ratio. In fact, in 2021 we had a surplus in the consolidated result of national accounts. Brazilian GDP increased by 1.2 per cent in the second quarter. The forecast for 2022 is 3 per cent growth.
We have the peace of mind of being on the right path — the path to prosperity shared among Brazilians
and, beyond that, with our neighbours and other partners around the world.
That is what we see, for example, in food production. Four decades ago, Brazil used to import food. Today we are one of the world’s largest exporters. That was only possible thanks to heavy investments in science and innovation, with a view to increasing productivity and sustainability. I pay tribute to Alysson Paolinelli, Brazilian candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize, for his role in expanding the Brazilian agricultural frontier through the use of new technologies. This year the country has already started the largest grain harvest in our history. We estimate it to be at least 270 million tons. In a few years, Brazil will also make the transition from importer to exporter of wheat.
For the period 2022 to 2023, total production is expected to exceed 300 million tons. On a recent visit to Brazil, the Director-General of the World Trade Organization stated that if it were not for Brazilian agribusiness, the planet would go hungry, as we feed more than 1 billion people worldwide. Our agribusiness is a source of national pride. I also note that, in the area of sustainable development, Brazil’s achievements lend credibility to our country’s international action.
With regard to the environment and sustainable development, Brazil is part of the solution and a reference for the world. Two thirds of Brazilian territory is host to native vegetation, which is exactly as it was when Brazil was discovered in 1500. In the Brazilian Amazon, an area equivalent to all of Western Europe, more than 80 per cent of the forest remains untouched, contrary to what is reported by the mainstream national and international media.
It is essential that, when taking care of the environment, we do not overlook people. The Amazon region is home to more than 20 million inhabitants, including indigenous and riverside dwellers, whose livelihoods depend on economic use of the forest. We brought the Internet to more than 11,000 rural schools and more than 500 indigenous communities.
Brazil began its energy transition almost half a century ago, in reaction to the oil crises at that time. Today we have a modern and sustainable biofuel industry. That industry contributes to the cleanest energy mix among the Group of 20 countries. About 84 per cent of our electricity matrix is currently renewable — a goal that many developed countries hope to achieve only by 2040 or 2050.
Last year, Brazil was chosen by the United Nations as the global champion of energy transition. We have the potential to become a major global exporter of clean energy. We have a surplus, already under construction, that can reach more than 100 gigawatts between biomass, onshore wind and solar, in addition to the unexplored opportunity of 700-gigawatt offshore wind farms, with one of the lowest production costs in the world. Those sources will produce green hydrogen for export. Part of this 100 per cent clean energy opens up the possibility for us to become suppliers of highly competitive industrial products, especially in the Brazilian north-east, with one of the smallest carbon footprints in the world.
The sustainable development agenda is impacted in many ways by threats to international peace and security. We built the United Nations from the ruins of the Second World War. What motivated us back then was the determination to avoid repeating the cycle of destruction that marked the first half of the twentieth century. To some extent, we can say that we were successful.
But today the conflict in Ukraine serves as a warning.
A reform of the United Nations is essential if we are to find world peace. In the specific case of the Security Council, after 25 years of debates, it is clear that we need to look for innovative solutions. Brazil delves into this topic based on experience that goes back to the beginnings of the United Nations. This is the eleventh time that we have held a non-permanent seat at the Council. We have tried to do our best to achieve peaceful and negotiated solutions to international conflicts, always led by the Charter of the United Nations and international law.
Brazil also has an extensive history of participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations. From Suez to Angola, from Haiti to Lebanon, we have always supported peacekeeping.
We also contributed to peace by opening our borders to those seeking a chance to restart their lives in our country. Since 2018, over 6 million Venezuelan brothers have been forced to leave their country. Many of them came to Brazil. Our response to that challenge was “Operation Welcome”, which has become an international benchmark. More than 350,000 Venezuelans have found in Brazilian territory emergency assistance, protection, documentation and
the possibility of a fresh start. All of them have access to the labour market, to public services and social benefits. In recent months, around 600 Venezuelans have been arriving in Brazil every day on foot, the vast majority of them being women and children weighing on average 15 kilos less than before and running away from violence and hunger.
The Brazilian humanitarian reception policy goes beyond Venezuela. We have also received Haitians, Syrians, Afghans and Ukrainians.
It has been seven months since the conflict began in Ukraine. It is a source of great concern — not only in Europe but throughout the world. I would like, first, to reiterate Brazil’s gratitude to the countries that helped with the evacuation of Brazilian citizens who were in Ukraine when the conflict started. I refer especially to Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and the Czech Republic. The operation was successful. We left no one behind, not even their pets.
With regard to the conflict itself, Brazil has been guided by the principles of international law and the United Nations Charter. Those principles are also enshrined in our Constitution. We call for an immediate ceasefire, the protection of civilians and non-combatants, the preservation of critical infrastructure in order to assist the population and the maintenance of all channels of dialogue between the parties in conflict. Those are the first steps to achieving a lasting and sustainable solution. We have been working towards that goal. At the United Nations and elsewhere, we have tried to avoid the hampering of dialogue channels caused by the polarization around the conflict. In that regard, we are against diplomatic and economic isolation.
The fallout of the conflict can already be felt in world prices for foodstuffs, fuel and other raw materials. This situation distances us all from the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals. Countries that once presented themselves as leaders of the low-carbon economy have now turned to dirty sources of energy. That is a serious setback for the environment.
We support all efforts to reduce the economic impact of this crisis, but we do not believe that the best way is to adopt unilateral and selective sanctions that are inconsistent with international law. Those measures have hampered the economic recovery and undermined the human rights of vulnerable populations, including in European countries.
The conflict in Ukraine can be resolved only through negotiation and dialogue. I make a plea to the parties, as well as to the entire international community, to not pass up any opportunity to end the conflict and ensure peace. The stability, security and prosperity of humankind are at serious risk if the conflict continues.
I have been an unconditional supporter of the freedom of speech. Moreover, under my Administration, Brazil has made an effort to bring the right to the freedom of religion to the core of the international human rights agenda. It is essential to ensure that everyone has the right to freely worship and practice their religious orientation without discrimination. I would like to state here that Brazil is ready to welcome the Catholic priests and nuns who have suffered cruel persecution by the dictatorial regime in Nicaragua. Brazil repudiates religious persecution wherever it occurs in the world.
Other fundamental values for Brazilian society with implications for the human rights agenda are the defence of the family, the right to life after conception, the right to self-defence and the rejection of gender ideology. I would also like to stress our commitment to women’s rights. Our effort to enact over 70 legal norms on the subject since the beginning of my Administration, in 2019, is proof of that commitment.
We resolutely combat violence against women. That is part of our broader priority of ensuring public security for all Brazilians. The results can be seen in our Government — a 7.7 per cent drop in the number of femicides and a decrease in the general number of deaths by homicide. In 2017, there were 30 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants; now there are only 19. Violence in rural areas has also plummeted, and land tenure by the most in need has increased. Under my Administration, we delivered 400,000 rural property deeds, 80 per cent to women.
We are making efforts in Brazil to have strong and independent women so they can reach their goals. Since 2019, First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro has brought new meaning to volunteer work, with special attention to people with disabilities and rare diseases.
On 7 September, Brazil celebrated 200 years of history as an independent nation. Millions of Brazilians took to the streets, called upon by their Government, wearing the colours of their flag. It was the largest civic demonstration in the history of our country, a people that believes in God, nation, family and freedom."
Bulgaria,BGR,Europe,"  7,052,000 ",17953,6.159999847,5.1,74.928,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,681,9.66,"  7,030,844 ",99.70,8.69,"We are living in unprecedented times with many challenges — war and insecurity, energy and food crises, climate change and the lingering consequences of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. And that list of challenges is far from complete. The abrupt increase in security risks and the tectonic instabilities that have occurred since the previous session’s general debate are threatening to destroy the rules-based world order — the order that has been built here in this Hall by all of us, by sovereign States and the peoples of the world. That is why a great majority of the speakers during this year’s debate believe our biggest security risk to be the war that the Russian Federation is waging against its neighbour, breaking basic international rules and violating the Charter of the United Nations itself.
This illegal military aggression by a permanent member of the Security Council is not only undermining global security but also putting the international rules-based order in jeopardy. Bulgaria is deeply concerned about the recent escalation of the conflict and the partial mobilization announced by the Russian Federation. We reject the ongoing sham referendums in occupied Ukraine and consider them neither free nor fair and with no binding force. In those unfortunate circumstances, each and every contribution towards achieving more stability and cooperation among States in different regions must be encouraged and welcomed.
As a South-East European country, Bulgaria attaches the utmost importance to peace, stability and prosperity in the Western Balkans region. We are confident that the transformative power of the European Union integration process and inclusive regional cooperation are both the most powerful tools for achieving a common space of democratic governance, a market economy and political, economic and social sustainability. We will continue to support such countries on their path to the European Union.
Bulgaria is concerned by the lack of progress in the efforts to advance the Middle East peace process, as well as the recent escalation of tensions in the Gaza Strip. Enhanced cooperation between international and regional partners is needed to provide a political horizon for the resumption of bilateral Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. A negotiated and viable two-State solution that allows both Palestinians and Israelis to live side by side in peace, within secure and recognized borders, is essential to the stability of the entire Middle East.
Bulgaria is following with concern the critical developments in Afghanistan, including the human rights situation and the restrictions imposed by the
Taliban on the rights of women, girls’ access to education and journalists.
The war in Europe has global repercussions. The Russian aggression against Ukraine has caused food insecurity and an energy crisis, which have devastating socioeconomic impacts on countries worldwide. Even before, the global food system was already under pressure due to factors such as climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the crisis has escalated dramatically because of the war, as disruptions in food, energy and financial systems in more than 90 countries around the world have put 1.7 billion people at risk.
Bulgaria highly appreciates the United Nations- and Tiirkiye-mediated deal on the resumption of grain exports from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, and we fully share the assessment that that very welcome development has the potential to significantly alleviate the current food crisis. Nevertheless, the situation remains critical, and the need for humanitarian assistance to a number of countries in the global South persists.
Some two and a half years ago, we were faced with the first lethal pandemic of the twenty-first century, which changed our lifestyles, the way of doing business and, above all, the way in which we communicate with each other. The COVID-19 pandemic also triggered a revolution in human online activities and interaction through various digital communication platforms. It also caused huge quakes in both societies and economies, deepened the gap between the rich and the poor, applying both to people as well as to entire nations, and wiped out at least a decade of progress made in reaching the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Our planet is visibly suffering from the devastating effects of climate change: deforestation, desertification, weather extremes, environmental degradation and the loss of biodiversity, affecting in one way or another each and every one of us, no matter where we live. Action is urgently needed.
We are deeply concerned about the humanitarian and food crises in Africa, especially in the Sahel and Lake Chad regions, which are further exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. They are an additional burden on post-COVID-19 recovery efforts. In that context, specific and comprehensive responses that address the short-term needs of the countries concerned, as well as strengthening their resilience and sustainability, are needed. We therefore commend the efforts of both the United Nations and the African Union to address those challenges.
Dialogue and cooperation with the countries of the Indo-Pacific region are becoming particularly important. Bulgaria supports the strengthening of partnerships with like-minded countries from the region in energy connectivity, digitalization, people-to-people contacts, security of supplies, security and defence, countering disinformation, et cetera. As the country currently holding the presidency of the Economic and Social Council, we attach great importance to the priorities of emerging economies with regard to sustainable development, as well as to the priorities of small island States, taking into account their specific needs, including their existential struggle over the impact of global warming and the constant sea-level rise.
I would now like to share another very important and pressing issue. The world finds itself at a watershed moment for human rights, as it faces numerous challenges in that regard. Neither peace nor prosperity can be meaningful concepts without full respect for human rights and human dignity. We are a staunch supporter of the universality and indivisibility of human rights, democracy and the rule of law. As an active member of the Human Rights Council between 2019 and 2021, Bulgaria firmly promoted the rights of the child, women and girls, as well as their empowerment. Gender equality and the protection of the rights of persons with disabilities are also key priorities for my country. Strongly committed to further advancing the human rights agenda worldwide, Bulgaria has presented its candidature for membership of the Human Rights Council for the period from 2024 to 2026.
Education is a basic human right, with the transformative power to foster a fairer and more inclusive world. Education is a solid foundation for future peace, tolerance and sustainable development. Over the past couple of years, the COVID-19 pandemic further limited the access of children to education in the developing world. That motivated my country to play an active role in the preparation of the Transforming Education Summit, and we are encouraged by the successful outcome of that event.
Let me now briefly turn to United Nations reform in three closely interrelated areas: governance, peace and security and sustainable development. We cannot be complacent about the pace of reform so far, and we
must seize the historic wave of opportunity to make strides in the process. Bulgaria therefore supports the acceleration of the reform efforts, in line with the proposals in the Secretary-General’s report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), aimed at reaching a new global consensus on our future and stepping up multilateral cooperation to achieve it.
We support the comprehensive reform of the Security Council. We have reached a critical juncture where it is untenable to maintain the status quo. The current situation where that highest organ of the Organization is failing to play its key role under the Charter of the United Nations cannot be tolerated by the international community. That is a duty that we owe to the future generations. Allocating at least one additional non-permanent seat to the Eastern European States in a reformed Security Council remains a priority for my country.
During the seventy-seventh session, Bulgaria will remain strongly committed to its financial obligations to the United Nations and is concerned about the persisting liquidity challenges, which undermine the ability of the Organization to implement its mandates and carry out its approved programme of work. We will continue to support the Secretary-General’s policies to improve the financial situation of the United Nations. Bulgaria consistently ranks among the Member States that have contributed on time and in full to both the United Nations regular and peacekeeping budgets.
Allow me to conclude by sharing with the Assembly our vision of the way ahead. We will have to navigate uncharted waters. If we build upon the consolidated and unanimous approach of upholding the principles and the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, we may exit the present crisis, but we will have a long way to go to re-establish security and economic stability after the war.
The world of tomorrow will be very different from what we expected it to be not too long ago. Whether or not we will be up to the challenge will depend on our unity and ability to act together, as one, to mitigate negative side effects, readjust our lives to the new realities in the world and shore up rules-based multilateralism, with the United Nations at its core."
Burkina Faso,BFA,Africa,"  19,751,000 ",1561,6.303999901,4.9,61.174,Malaria,Cardiovascular Disease,Lower Respiratory Infection,1521,7.70,"  3,744,244 ",18.96,4.53,"I would like to begin by expressing my warmest and most heartfelt congratulations to you, Sir, on your election as President of the United Nations General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session. I am confident that your vast experience, deep knowledge of the United Nations system and well-known commitment to multilateral diplomacy will ensure the success of your mandate. I also want to assure you of the full support of the delegation of Burkina Faso in your exercise of your burdensome duty and in the success of our work. My congratulations also go to your predecessor, Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for his admirable stewardship of the work of the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session. And I solemnly reaffirm Burkina Faso’s gratitude to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his constant, resolute and renewed commitment to peace and security and development.
I would like to take the opportunity today in this Hall to welcome the holding of the Transforming Education Summit, which has enabled a broad mobilization of actors in the education arena. I dare to hope that the global commitment to the implementation of the Summit’s conclusions will contribute significantly to accelerating progress towards achieving quality education for all, particularly in the countries of the South.
The theme of the General Assembly at this session, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, aptly highlights the urgency and the historic responsibility borne by the political, economic and social actors of our time in the face of the multiple crises facing our planet. While the world is gradually recovering from the coronavirus disease pandemic, other scourges — such as terrorism, intra- and inter-State conflicts and the humanitarian and food security crises they engender, along with climate change and its perverse effects — continue to blight daily life across the world. They serve as a reminder that we are fragile, individually and collectively, that countries and peoples are interdependent, and that international solidarity is urgently needed. If we want
to save humankind from collective and inescapable peril, we must not ignore that reminder.
The end of the Cold War gave us an opportunity to dream and to aspire to a world based on consensus, with a focus on the core values of peace, justice, freedom, democracy and solidarity. But that dream was an illusion, because for some time now we have unfortunately been seeing nationalism and inward-looking attitudes resurgent in certain parts of the planet, while freedom and democracy are shrinking in others. We have seen the readiness of certain countries to impose their world view on others. And we are seeing games of rivalry and confrontation play out between Powers as they vie for the political, military or economic control of certain parts of the world. Simply put, actors in the international community have been brazenly spreading a unipolar and monochromatic world view that reflects their own ideology and interests.
We urgently need to regroup and develop the inner strength to refrain from succumbing to those temptations. Let us instead emphasize a spirit of solidarity that is aimed at preserving our world’s diversity and realizing the principle of the interdependence of peoples, a world in which everyone can contribute to managing its affairs. Burkina Faso firmly believes that humankind’s chance of survival lies in accepting our differences and diversity and using them resourcefully. Far from being a source of antagonism or hostility, our differences and diversity represent an excellent opportunity to find complementarity and solidarity — a way of encouraging peaceful coexistence and sustainable development that costs us nothing.
The key challenges facing our world today are well known to everyone. They include primarily peace and security, democracy and sustainable development, climate change and environment and health and education. I want to emphasize that the only way we can meet those challenges is by working together. That is why we must try to extend our concerns beyond our individual and private interests, which are often factors in crises, in order to maintain peaceful relations with one another. I therefore call earnestly on all the actors of the international community, whether they are from the North or the South and regardless of the political, economic or military power they have, to take that approach.
Certain issues have recurred on the General Assembly’s plenary agenda for several years now, including Palestine, the Western Sahara, debt, climate change, the embargo on Cuba, the war in Ukraine and Security Council reform. In order to resolve each of those issues, on behalf of Burkina Faso I strongly recommend that we respected the rule of law, champion justice and equity and let common sense lead the way.
I would now like to say a few words about the situation in my country and the aim of the political transition currently under way, in connection with the General Assembly’s very relevant theme this session and the goals of the Charter of the United Nations. On 24 January, a group of young patriots felt compelled to take responsibility for the public management of the nation’s affairs in a natural response to a drift in political governance, growing insecurity in our country and the gradual and continuing disintegration of the State, and they did so by putting an end to a regime that while democratically elected was also mired in chaos. But we have no intention of justifying or promoting destabilizing practices or violating the constitutional order.
While the 24 January movement was technically illegal and perhaps contrary to principles dear to the United Nations and the international community as a whole, when we consider how things were being handled we believe it was necessary, indeed vital, to disrupt the constitutional order. It was a matter of our nation’s survival above all. That is why the movement, which is focused on safeguarding the territory and implementing reforms, enjoys genuine popular legitimacy among public opinion in our country, and that enthusiasm and popular support have continued for the transitional authorities, which I have been leading for eight months now.
The security situation in Burkina Faso began to deteriorate in 2015, before reaching a low point in 2020 and 2021. The recent events that disrupted my country’s march towards democracy have resulted from a failure to respond appropriately to the security crisis, as well as terrible political governance, which among other things led to the largest number of internally displaced persons in the political history of our country and subregion — 1,520,012 people as of 31 August. We are also facing a humanitarian and food crisis unprecedented in the country’s history, as well as the closure of several thousand schools, with half a million students deprived of education, and economic stagnation induced by the slowdown, if not total halt, in economic activity in a number of industries such as mining, tourism and hotels, as well as agriculture
and livestock farming and transportation. Those difficulties, which I have touched on briefly, are part of a wider subregional security context of attacks perpetrated by various terrorist groups operating in the Sahel, particularly in its centre, which includes Burkina Faso, Mali and the Niger.
Nevertheless, in order to deal with this, the transitional Government, relying largely on new internal initiatives, has shouldered its responsibilities by developing an action plan based on four strategic objectives — combating terrorism and restoring territorial integrity, responding to the humanitarian crisis, rebuilding the State and improving governance and ensuring national reconciliation and social cohesion. In order to achieve those objectives, we have launched some major initiatives.
The first is to restructure our national security apparatus and to take firm and vigorous action on the ground to combat terrorism and armed groups. The second is to combat radicalization, hate speech and the stigmatization of communities. The third is to implement a policy of de-radicalization and social and professional reintegration for reformed combatants from armed groups. The fourth is to support the resettlement and socioeconomic integration of internally displaced persons and those affected by terrorism. Lastly, we aim to combat corruption and promote justice, equity and education for peace and for our citizens.
However, Burkina Faso’s will and determination alone in combating terrorism will not be enough to make a long-lasting impact. The support of the international community is both crucial and expected, and it is particularly urgent for Burkina Faso, whose geographic position makes it a buffer zone for curbing the spread of terrorism to countries on the coast such as Benin, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana and Togo. Ensuring stability, security and peace in the Sahel is not just a matter of concern for the countries of our region because the current situation in the Sahel countries, needless to say, is the result of terrorism’s migration from North Africa towards the South.
The current situation in the Sahel, a result of that cross-border impact, is a problem that is jeopardizing international peace and security. It is therefore important for the international community to understand it better and be more involved. The efforts that have been made so far are certainly welcome, but they fall short of what is needed, given the reality on the ground. In that context, I welcome the initiative that the Chairperson of the African Union and the Secretary-General of the United Nations have taken to mandate the former President of the Niger Mahamadou Issoufou to lead the joint African Union-United Nations Independent High-Level Panel on Security and Development in the Sahel, which should produce recommendations on how to strengthen the international response to the security crisis in the Sahel with a view to finding a comprehensive and lasting solution.
I appeal to our bilateral and multilateral technical and financial partners to support the transition action plan we adopted on 6 May. Burkina Faso is hoping for their support in order to close a gap of approximately $4.5 billion out of a total budget of about $18 billion. The Government has also begun developing an emergency transition programme, which will be devoted to priority projects, as well as innovative projects and others expected to significantly benefit people’s living conditions. We are therefore counting on our friends and partners to mobilize support to that end.
The transition authorities in Burkina Faso are aware of their responsibilities to our people and their duty to the international community, and I want to make it clear that we will not abandon those responsibilities. In that regard, on 3 July we agreed to a dynamic compromise with the Economic Community of West African States on the duration of the transition, which was set at 24 months from 1 July, and on the need to set up a transitional monitoring and evaluation mechanism based on indicators relating to security, the restoration of Government services to the occupied areas and the return of displaced persons.
I firmly believe that achieving significant progress in those three areas will help create the conditions for holding credible and transparent elections with a view to a return to a normal constitutional order. Such progress can be achieved only with the substantial support of the international community, for which I urge wholeheartedly from this rostrum today. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all of our bilateral, multilateral and private technical and financial partners who are supporting us or have promised to do so. I would also like to invite those that have not yet done so to join us and support us as we strive to rebuild and strengthen the economic, social and security fabric of the country.
The peoples of our planet, rich or poor, powerful or weak, need a secure and peaceful world in which all can live in peace and fully exercise their rights.
The Sahel is currently riddled with armed groups that are causing devastation all over the globe. They threaten the security both of the region and the rest of the world. If nothing is decisively and urgently done to help our countries, we may see terrorism flare up in the countries of the Gulf of Guinea and then the rest of the world — starting with Europe, the continent closest to Africa. Nor will any precautionary or preventive measure be able to prevent terrorism from spreading to the other side of the Atlantic if the Sahel is left to its fate. And as long as the young people of the Sahel and neighbouring countries no longer have hope in their own lands, nothing will be able to prevent them from attempting the perilous migration to Europe via the Sahara and the Mediterranean.
Against the backdrop of terrorism-inflicted misery in the region, the Sahel has become a stage for futile rivalries and shameful greed, which make the situation even worse. The countries of the Sahel deserve better than this and need solidarity and help — but not just any help. We need help that enables us to no longer ask for help — the kind that will make our need for help obsolete. And we need it to be consistent with our beliefs and to respect our dignity.
I would like to conclude my remarks by urging all the actors of the international community to show greater solidarity with one another, because that is the best way to address the challenges of our time and preserve the interests of all. Raoul Follereau said that no one has the right to be happy all by themselves.
Let us therefore make sure that there are no more malnourished children without education or instruction; that there are no more young people without training or jobs; that there are no more peasants without land to live in dignity; that there are no more workers whose rights are trampled; that the abundance of some is not the cause of the destitution of others; that force does not prevail over truth and justice; and finally, that the reasons of our selfishness never prevail over the demands of the dignity of humankind and peoples.
I vow that Burkina Faso will spare no effort to make its contribution to the building of a better, peaceful, united and prosperous world."

us to meet in the magnificent city of New York to participate in our Organization’s current session under the best conditions.
At the outset of my remarks, allow me to express my sincere thanks to the Government and the people of the United States of America, and more particularly to the people of New York, for the exemplary welcome and hospitality extended to me and my delegation. I would also like to express my warm and heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Csaba Korosi, for his auspicious election as President of the General Assembly of the United Nations at its seventy-seventh session. Burundi, through me, assures the President of its full support and cooperation throughout his mandate in the service of humankind. I would also like to express my deep gratitude to his predecessor, Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for the remarkable work he has done under extremely difficult conditions marked by the ongoing crisis resulting from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and by security crises in several regions of the world. In that context, I pay a well-deserved tribute to the Secretary- General of the Organization, Mr. Antonio Guterres, who has spared no effort in accomplishing his mission well despite a difficult situation involving various crises and paradoxes.
As the Burundian adage states: “In a climate of peace, a pruning knife can serve as a lawnmower” — in other words, where there is peace, anything is possible. The world today should take inspiration from this. Unfortunately, the world has become an immense tower from which we witness, with tears in our eyes, gruesome acts in some nations due to war, horrible massacres, refugee flows, food insecurity and the destabilization of world economic systems. The countries of the world are experiencing the knock-on effects of the situation in Ukraine. In Africa, terrorism and violent extremism continue to strike in the Sahel region, the Horn of Africa and in Central Africa, with a tendency to spread to the southern region of Africa. The same is true in other parts of the world — as has been noted, terrorism has no borders and climate change, which causes famine, has no limits. However, together, with political will, I am confident that we can overcome these scourges.
I am confident because my country, Burundi, has seen all too much, with repeated political crises that have destroyed not only human lives, but also the environment. Today we have recovered, and the country is well on the way to socioeconomic development. Burundi is striving to make progress in this direction, using the dividends of peace, security, stability and the social cohesion that has re-emerged thanks to Burundians themselves and to the contribution of the international community. We therefore hope that everyone will embrace the spirit of peace, fraternity and justice so that all the peoples of the world may fully enjoy their right to live well and in dignity. On the humanitarian level, Burundi has welcomed on its soil, with warmth and dignity, thousands of refugees of all ethnicities from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Peace is a topic that is close to our hearts; its absence weighs heavily on the lives of our peoples. It is in this spirit that we will never allow ourselves to shy away from implementing security decisions taken by this important, dignified international Organization, the United Nations. With this in mind, Burundi continues to fight tooth and nail to contribute to the return of peace in countries in which it has been disrupted, in the framework of the United Nations, the African Union or the region. Our interventions in Somalia and the Central African Republic are testimony to this. Similarly, Burundi is committed to contributing to the return of peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the framework of the East African Community initiative. I take this opportunity to ask the international community to support the Nairobi process to help the Congolese people in distress.
With further regard to peace and security, by participating in this meeting, I am led to humbly request the involvement of the United Nations in tracking down the terrorist groups that are beginning to infiltrate our subregion, not to mention those already active in other parts of the world. The East African Community, of which Burundi holds the presidency, has just welcomed a new member, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and, together with the other heads of State of the member countries, we have set ourselves the goal of stabilizing the entire community, so that our countries’ populations can finally focus on socioeconomic development projects.
That is why the Government of Burundi is developing transport infrastructure, including road, rail, air and water transport, in order to achieve the interconnected, multimodal approach at the national and subregional levels that is imperative for my country. Burundi is working closely with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United Republic of Tanzania to achieve the ambitious Uvinza-Musongati- Gitega-Bujumbura-Uvira-Kindu railroad project that
will link the three countries, as well as the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. This megaproject will not only boost the economies of the three countries, but will also facilitate the movement of goods and people in the subregion.
We would like the States Members of the United Nations to stand as one to protect and promote all the rights that humankind must enjoy without distinction. While we appreciate what is already being done, work remains to be done in order for people to fully exercise all the rights to which they are entitled as human beings.
I would therefore like to take this opportunity to warmly thank the international community for its efforts to restore peace and stability in my country. In that regard, I should like to inform this august Assembly that equitable justice for all is today a reality, and that human rights, including freedom of expression and freedom of the press, are respected throughout Burundi.
Unfortunately, however, some officials, under the banner of some of the Organization’s entities, are discouraging this positive development by politicizing democracy and the fight against impunity. In some countries, including my own, when democracy, as defined, takes root, some United Nations officials distort that democracy, calling it untrustworthy and non-inclusive to perpetuate unnecessary tensions. Whereas we fight on a daily basis against impunity, some of these officials still seek to disqualify our actions. It is therefore high time that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights align itself with our countries to enable a common understanding of the direction of our countries’ policies, instead of trying to control their actions at a distance through committees and offices of special rapporteurs. The time has come for the United Nations to recognize the progress made by my country over the past 17 years and to understand that the status of “fragile country” no longer applies to Burundi.
People are at the heart of the economy, from the family to the global level. We must therefore contribute to the development of human capital by providing our peoples with appropriate tools, experience and knowledge adapted to the demands of contemporary life. We must find solutions to counter the threats to our economy, health, education system and peaceful coexistence — in short, threats to our way of life within our countries and among the countries of the world.
We know that the United Nations seeks to improve the living conditions of the world’s population through access to sufficient household income to ensure a decent standard of living. Education is a key element in achieving that. In terms of education, I could not be more explicit than Nelson Mandela when he said: “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” So many years after this famous line was spoken, this idea for effecting positive change in our communities remains relevant. Education creates aspirations and ambitions for the future in young people and is an effective tool in the fight against violence and terrorism.
That is why, in my country, we are initiating reforms that rethink policy regarding the education system in order to turn our youth into members of, rather than tributaries to, the public service. We are pleased to note that, in my country, making education free has significantly increased enthusiasm towards school among girls and boys alike and that the dropout rate in elementary grades, which is often linked to food insufficiency, distance from schools and inability to afford school fees, has decreased significantly. In order to turn youth into agents of peace and inclusive development in Burundi, we have put in place an ambitious programme of youth economic empowerment and employment with the aim of reducing unemployment by creating jobs for young people through entrepreneurship. Alongside this programme, we have set up a youth investment bank and an accelerator, guarantee and support fund to facilitate access to credit.
The same is true for women, who account for a high percentage of Burundian youth. We have established a women’s investment bank and are pursuing reforms to improve women’s health and education. The Office of the First Lady of Burundi has opened a hospital to treat obstetric fistulas and, together with Burundi’s development partners, continues to innovate to greatly improve the lives of Burundian women.
Meanwhile, managing the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic is an urgent task. To that end, I would like to make a strong appeal to all development partners of the African continent to take courageous measures to support the economies of African States, which have been hard hit by the various current crises. As no country in the world was created with the idea of forever receiving assistance, this support should be done through mutually beneficial strategic partnerships focused on, among others, investment, trade promotion and technology transfers.
In order to develop human capital and to make the population dynamic and productive, my Government is providing each commune with at least one hospital and health centres to prevent and treat diseases, including from epidemics and pandemics. While we are proud of having been able to effectively combat the COVID-19 pandemic, the fight continues. Furthermore, free health care has been provided for children under five years of age and pregnant women who give birth in public hospitals and health centres, which has significantly reduced infant mortality.
The efforts aimed at my country’s economic development must primarily focus on developing the agricultural sector. To that end, my Government has declared 2022 as “Year of Agriculture in Burundi” under the general theme “Agriculture, source of the national economy”. Our agricultural development programme is all about changing mindsets and practices. We are encouraging the population to aim higher by producing not only for local consumption but also, and especially, for export, to join forces to work together in agricultural cooperatives and to progressively replace hoes with modern tools and agricultural technologies.
Concerning the environment, Burundi has not remained idle, especially since we have experienced drought in some regions, the flooding of rivers and lakes and landslides that sometimes carry away human lives, houses and crops, thus leading to food insufficiency. In the light of this, Burundi has joined the global consensus by carrying out environmental protection, conservation and management works through various activities throughout the country. Furthermore, Burundi is learning about climate change resilience, not only through the practice of hill irrigation but also through soil protection efforts, such as the drawing of contour lines and generalized reforestation, under the government project entitled “Ewe Burundi urambaye”, or “Covering Burundi”. Every Thursday is dedicated to this purpose throughout the country.
We must also ensure that we progressively develop the infrastructure, in particular energy and transport, to support production and better ensure the growth of other sectors that drive growth and employment. The Government of Burundi is working on a huge project to develop the energy sector by mobilizing resources through co-financing and private-sector investment. The aim is to develop the potential of hydroelectricity, solar energy, peat, geothermal resources and municipal waste. The two sectors I have just highlighted also provide crucial support for the exploitation of mining potential. We want to forge a mutually advantageous and balanced technical and financial partnership in the exploration, exploitation and processing of mining and geological products, as surveys have revealed a subsoil that is very rich and as yet untouched.
For peace and development to become reality, we have to prioritize good governance and the sound management of public finances, which not only helps to relieve the people’s frustrations, which are at the root of social conflicts, but also enables us to plan the national economy properly. I want to point out that we have strong national mechanisms for combating corruption and related activities. Acts of corruption are dealt with effectively and our citizens are satisfied with our performance in this area. In terms of economic activity, Burundi is on the right track, leveraging mining resources as well as road, sea and, soon, rail transport routes for economic actors. Investors should know that the Lake Tanganyika shoreline is being developed for tourism and new tourist sites are being created in the interior of the country.
Before concluding my remarks, I would like to once again reaffirm my country’s determination to maintain good diplomatic relations and mutually beneficial, win-win cooperation with all States and international organizations in order to confront the fundamental challenges that are a threat to us all. We welcome our resumption of good political, diplomatic and economic relations that had previously been frozen with various States and international organizations. Our ardent wish is to maintain strong relations with States and international organizations towards a bright future for Burundi and every country in the world."

At the same time, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid for his efforts in leading the work of the Assembly at its seventy-sixth session, during a very tumultuous time.
Our theme of this session, entitled “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, is indeed relevant to the current context. Global uncertainties have been exacerbated by the escalation of armed conflicts, the arms race, the rise in small-scale security alliances, the technology and trade wars, the imposition of economic sanctions and the mounting threats to multilateralism.
In fact, the war in Ukraine has not just complicated international relations in Europe but caused serious economic disruptions and exacerbated our food and energy security. The escalation of hostilities involving more and more actors, directly or indirectly and with no end in sight, coupled with the threat of nuclear war, has had serious impacts on the world at large.
The situation in the Korean peninsula remains alarming due to the preparations for a seventh nuclear test. This year, North Korea has launched dozens of ballistic missiles in response to military drills. In addition, the tension between the United States and China over the Taiwan issue is also of concern.
Overall, in this very challenging environment and as a country that has achieved a hard-earned peace in our own history, Cambodia is making great efforts to engage constructively with the United Nations in upholding international peace and security and promoting respect for the fundamental principles and values of the Charter of the United Nations and international law.
The present gathering reflects the remarkable success of our collective efforts to overcome the unprecedented pandemic, yet the battle against that global health crisis is not over yet. New variants and other infectious diseases are emerging; what else could emerge in the future? A strong global health system, particularly the World Health Organization with its central coordination role, could help to build resilient and sustainable national health systems. Open and transparent multilateral engagement in the distribution of vaccines, driven by a true principle of shared responsibility, is the only way to prepare for and prevent future pandemics, coupled with the sharing of lessons learned and best practices, the transfer of technologies in vaccine research and development.
Moreover, another existential threat facing humankind is our vulnerability to climate change. We need to transform the process of addressing climate change issues today, not tomorrow. It has been 50 years since Governments were warned about the need to change our production and consumption patterns to avoid disaster. Sadly, ever since, we have only seen more loss of biodiversity, more land degradation and a growing scarcity of fresh water.
Our collective action must focus on global mitigation efforts to promote climate-resilient development. Our commitment to lowering the mean global temperature by 1.5° C requires dedicated climate financing and technology transfer to facilitate meaningful transition in mitigation and adaptation
efforts. The Glasgow outcomes adopted at the twenty- sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change must be implemented with great urgency, bearing in mind the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.
Moreover, the threat of the trade and economic decoupling arising from the United States-China rivalry will certainly dampen the prospects for global growth. Therefore, the fundamental transformative solution of the social, economic and political process is to strengthen the rules-based multilateral trading system, with the World Trade Organization at its heart, that can promote open international trade, reduce trade barriers and ensure the resilience of regional and global value chains.
Meanwhile, we need to pay greater attention to inclusive digital policies and regulatory frameworks conducive to greater investment in digital infrastructure, which is so essential to bridging the growing digital divides and generating new sources of growth. Enhancing green economic development is also an indispensable part of nurturing sustainable socioeconomic development through the expansion of cooperation in building green infrastructure, promoting energy transition and leveraging green technology.
This year, Cambodia is honoured to hold the chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which is now 55-year-old. We are proud to celebrate our historic milestone and the remarkable achievements we have made along the way. Throughout the years, ASEAN has been able to navigate the constantly changing geopolitical landscape to emerge as one of the most prominent and successful regional organizations, while making great strides in advancing its credibility and relevance in world affairs.
Our theme, “ASEAN A.C.T.:	Addressing
Challenges Together,” highlighting a strong spirit of togetherness, encompasses all the key pressing issues I mentioned earlier. Of course, these challenges have far-reaching implications for the ASEAN community building process and our external relations. But as Chair of ASEAN, Cambodia is as committed as ever to consolidating our efforts to address our shared goals of bringing benefits to our peoples based on the spirit of ASEAN centrality, unity and solidarity.
ASEAN has been successful in coordinating towards accepting Timor-Leste as the eleventh member of the Association. Earlier in this meeting, the President of Timor-Leste expressed his country’s sincere aspiration to ASEAN membership, and I hope that later this year or early in the next Timor-Leste will become the eleventh member of ASEAN, which represents more than 600 million people. I thank the President of Timor- Leste for attending my statement here in the General Assembly Hall and hope that his country will indeed join our community.
The situation in Myanmar is worrisome, with its direct implications for the security and stability of the whole region, but we must recognize that the crisis is complex and deep-rooted. As ASEAN Chair, Cambodia is fully committed to helping Myanmar resolve the crisis and all our efforts are aimed at seeking a cessation of violence, the delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in need, and the ongoing building of trust among all parties concerned to enable an inclusive political dialogue, as mandated by the ASEAN five-point consensus.
Over the past two years, the Royal Government of Cambodia has made strenuous proactive efforts to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) through the introduction of health measures, social and economic interventions and administrative measures. The Royal Government has set COVID-19 vaccination as a key strategic measure. As a result, Cambodia now has one of the highest coverage rates of vaccinated population in the world; in particular, we have achieved strong herd immunity, enabled the country to fully reopen in late 2021, and resumed all socioeconomic activities in the new normal. I take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to all friendly countries that have provided vaccines to Cambodia through bilateral and multilateral frameworks.
In the social sector, the Royal Government has worked with development partners, including United Nations agencies, to launch and scale up a number of important programmes, such as a cash- for-work programme, aimed at improving community infrastructure and providing additional employment opportunities, and a cash transfer programme for poor and vulnerable households to help alleviate hardship and maintain the livelihood of the poor.
In the economic sector, the Royal Government has made unremitting efforts to address chronic structural problems, boost competitiveness and promote economic diversification. In fact, the Royal Government has
addressed major challenges faced by businesses through the implementation of the New Investment Law, the Cambodia Digital Economy and Society Policy Framework 2021-2035, the Strategic Framework and Programmes for Economic Recovery in the Context of Living with COVID-19 in a New Normal 2021-2023, the Law on Public-Private Partnership and the adoption of free trade agreements, such as the Cambodia- China Free Trade Agreement, the Cambodia-Republic of Korea Free Trade Agreement, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. Overall, the Cambodian economy is estimated to achieve a growth rate of 5.4 per cent by 2022, supported by a strong recovery in manufacturing, tourism and agriculture.
With respect to the democratization process, the recent communal election held in June reflected our continued efforts as more than 80 per cent of registered voters cast their ballots in a free, fair, peaceful and transparent manner. The appreciation and full support of the Cambodian people for the unremitting efforts of the Royal Government of Cambodia in preserving peace, political stability and socioeconomic development and in the successful fight against the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an overwhelming majority vote in favour of the ruling party.
Furthermore, with regard to peacekeeping missions, Cambodia has continued deploying thousands of its peacekeeping forces to missions in countries in crisis. More than 15 per cent of Cambodian peacekeepers serving in United Nations missions are women. They are role models, inspiring women and girls in societies that are often male-dominated to exercise their rights and participate in the peace process.
On cooperation with the United Nations, I wish to note that just yesterday, the Supreme Court Chamber of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia issued a judgment upholding the life sentence of former Khmer Rouge Head of State for genocide, crimes against humanity and grave violations of the Geneva Conventions. That historical moment highlighted the outstanding cooperation between Cambodia and the United Nations, through the hybrid court, in bringing justice to the people of Cambodia, who suffered the heinous crime of auto-genocide. We can tell the world that the truth that has been revealed and justice served, and broadcast far and wide that this crime must never happen again in human history. I take this moment to express appreciation to all donors for providing a supporting budget and to our Cambodian compatriots for their cooperation in consolidating the national reconciliation process.
In conclusion, despite many challenges impacting our political, social, and economic progress, we remain as committed as always to attaining the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development goals."

I take this opportunity to assure him of the support of the Cameroonian delegation in achieving the objectives he has set.
I would also like to commend his predecessor, Minister Abdulla Shahid of Maldives, for the availability and efficiency with which he carried out his mandate throughout the seventy-sixth session.
Finally, allow me to reiterate our appreciation to our Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres who, despite the challenges and difficult times of the hour, has managed to stay the course by engaging with courage, determination and dedication in the defence of the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.
The President has proposed that this general debate be structured around the theme entitled “A watershed moment: transformative solutions in the face of intricate challenges”. That theme comes at the right time, in a particularly difficult context where the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has, for nearly three years, continued to affect the course and management of world affairs, whose complexity at the global, regional, subregional and national levels no longer needs to be demonstrated.
At the political level, rivalries for power, interest and hegemony are growing all over the world. As a corollary, the arms race is intensifying and continuing to entrench itself, especially on the seas and oceans and in outer space. Many hotbeds of tension in various regions of the world are the main theatres of operations where these shocks are felt, the waves and collateral effects of which amplify the threats and suffering that were already weighing heavy on peoples and nations in terms of loss of human life, material loss, migration, the deterioration of the environment, the disruption of financial systems, and food and energy crises, to name but a few.
That is the case in the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe that we have been witnessing for more than six months. Indeed, the Cameroonian Government is following with the greatest attention the conflict situation between Ukraine and Russia. As members know, the peaceful settlement of disputes between States has always been one of the fundamental principles of my country’s foreign policy. In that respect, Cameroon has, from the start of the crisis, reiterated its position by calling on the two parties to open negotiations with a view to reaching a joint solution so that the ideals of peace, security and sustainable development that underpin our Organization may prevail.
On the African continent too, hotbeds of tension persist. In our efforts to find solutions, we unfortunately see that some of our partners very often come up with preconceived recipes for everything and everyone. Faced with these trends, which continue year after year, it is important that the voice of Africa be heeded and supported, especially when it is raised by the African Union.
Economically, socially and culturally, the improvement observed before the COVID-19 pandemic is gradually giving way to a slowdown and even a decline in the progress and hope born of the courageous measures taken at the level multilateral and national since the early 2000s. From a legal point of view, international commitments are no longer being met or are being met in dribs and drabs, due to selfishness, insufficient political will and even the crisis in multilateralism. In such a context, it is no exaggeration to affirm that the fate of our species and the destiny of humankind are at stake.
The very first global and urgent challenge of the hour is the climate crisis. No one is ignorant of the fact that the climate is changing, the cycle of the seasons is out of order and fires are increasing, as are unprecedented floods and hurricanes in various parts of the world. Temperatures are reaching worrying levels; bodies of water, like Lake Chad, a source of life and prosperity for local populations, are reduced to their bare minimum.
This is the time to call for compliance with the commitments made within the framework of the various international conferences dedicated to climate change. It is therefore more than urgent that action be taken to finalize the rules for implementing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, particularly with regard to mobilizing financial resources in favour of developing countries and to raising our ambitions for the global climate.
The twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, scheduled to be held in Egypt late this year, is of crucial importance in that regard. It must provide urgent and decisive answers for the survival of the planet and better address that concern with innovative technologies.
The fight against climate change is a fight we all must wage on behalf of us all and every day. It is a truly universal responsibility. Aware of this major challenge and its responsibilities, Cameroon has made a commitment to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions and has set up an appropriate legal and institutional framework to that end.
Thanks to the forest massif of the Congo basin, one of the ecological lungs of the globe, the countries of Central Africa, united in the Central African Forest Commission, are making a major contribution to the search for solutions to climate change throughout the world. They ask in return that sufficient financial and technological resources, regularly promised by developed countries, be granted to them to enable them to keep, maintain and regenerate that important ecological basin. The same is true of the funding needed to implement projects designed as part of the Green Sahel initiative or the restoration of the Lake Chad basin.
Moreover, on the occasion of the revision of its nationally determined contribution, Cameroon has confirmed its commitment to this international momentum by increasing its greenhouse gas reduction commitments from 32 per cent to 35 per cent, 12 per cent of which are unconditional and 23 per cent of which are conditioned on the support of the international community for our efforts to address climate change.
For Cameroon, the fight against climate change is seen as a development opportunity and not as an insurmountable challenge. Each country holds one of the digits of the access code to the new era in which the planet aspires to breathe newly clean air, without carbon but rich in oxygen. The younger generations challenge us and call us to more action and not to wishful thinking.
Like other priority threats, the migration issue is acute. Despite the efforts of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and despite the efforts also made by host countries and development partners, millions of people continue to flee their homes and homelands to live in deplorable, inhuman conditions due to conflicts, cataclysms and multiple calamities. Faced with the magnitude of a human tragedy that challenges our collective conscience, we have the historic responsibility to act. And my country does not intend to shy away from it.
Faithful to its centuries-old tradition of tolerance and hospitality, Cameroon has always been a land of welcome, transit and mixing of peoples. Because of its stability, it represents a safe haven for many populations in search of peace. As all know, Cameroon currently hosts more than half a million refugees and asylum- seekers, which ranks it nineteenth among refugee hosting countries in the world.
In addition to the tripartite conventions signed with the UNHCR and the countries concerned to promote the return and resettlement of refugees in their countries of origin, my country last April hosted the Regional Ministerial Conference on Solutions in the Context of Forced Displacement related to the Central African crisis. The Conference was mandated by the Yaounde Declaration, which proposes common and inclusive solutions in favour of forcibly displaced Central Africans. My country plays an active part in all these initiatives, in accordance with the Global Compact on Refugees.
At a completely different level, we must also deplore the persistence of terrorism and violent extremism, the effects of which continue to weigh on the world order. Many regions are suffering from the resurgence of subversive operations carried out mainly by terrorist organizations, such as Boko Haram, which is rampant in the Lake Chad basin. The northern part of Cameroon has been badly affected. Faced with the danger and exponential advance of terrorism in various regions of the globe, my country renews its call for the strengthening of joint combat strategies. Such pooling of efforts is aimed at waging a true fight against that threat in all its forms and in all its manifestations, strengthening the capacities of the sovereign States that are its victims, tracking down its financing sources and neutralizing them, and amending and activating international and regional agreements for the uncompromising repression of ever-evolving terrorism.
The international community must continue to play its part, in strict respect for the sovereignty of States, in rebuilding and strengthening the fragile stability in all of these areas. We thank our bilateral and multilateral partners that are assisting the Joint Multinational Force established by the countries of the Lake Chad basin to combat and eradicate Boko Haram. That assistance deserves to be increased, given not only the proliferation of regional terrorist groups affiliated with the Islamic State, but also the increasingly sophisticated means of these small groups, whose numbers are constantly growing, owing to the enlistment of ex-combatants from former terrorist hotbeds that have been more or less pacified.
It is imperative that the international community continue to invest in the fight against poverty and inequality. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, reinforced by the Secretary-General’s report, Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), must be actively supported and fully implemented. What is most lacking at the moment for the execution of that programme are financial and technological means, as well as synergy among the partners involved in its execution. Cameroon is very committed to that path, as demonstrated by the recent submission of its voluntary national programme at the High-level Political Forum of the Economic and Social Council.
Because of its commitment to peace, its territorial integrity and its policy of national integration, the Government of my country continues to show openness and dialogue to put an end to the sociopolitical crisis in the regions of North-West and South-West. Thus, after convening the great national dialogue in 2019, we continued the process of accelerating and deepening decentralization. The disarmament, demobilization and reintegration centres created in those regions and in that of the Far North, host and train in various trades a large number of my young compatriots who have laid down their arms and renounced violence. The State exercises its sovereign prerogatives throughout the national territory. The Government’s current challenge is to pursue the implementation of the reconstruction of the affected regions through the humanitarian emergency plan and the development plan, drawn up in consultation with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), for the socioeconomic restoration of the regions, aforementioned.
At this point, I would like to sincerely salute the dynamic action and contribution of the UNDP in that regard and take this opportunity to thank our bilateral and multilateral partners that contribute to those various mechanisms, which are effective tools in the building of peace in Cameroon. I also make a strong appeal to the international community to mobilize more actively in favour of these plans in order to allow my country to remain the haven of peace that it has always been.
In general, regionalization in my country is under way and helping to strengthen the participation of Cameroonians in the management of the affairs of their country. These advances demonstrate that Cameroon is committed, irreversibly and resolutely, to the methodical completion of the democratic project it has set itself, and which responds to the legitimate wishes of the Cameroonian people and its project of economic revival by 2035. In this, Cameroon promotes in all circumstances, through structures created to that end, a constructive and regular dialogue between the various sociological components of its population, as well as the members of its diaspora, with a view to their mobilization for the immense and exhilarating national construction process.
Cameroon is firmly committed to and supportive of a reformed and reinvigorated international order and genuine multilateralism based on the ideals, purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations by the founding fathers of our Organization. This is why we support all the reforms currently under way within the United Nations aimed at establishing a more representative, fairer and more effective Security Council. In this regard and within the framework of the democratization of United Nations institutions, Cameroon reiterates its adherence to the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration unanimously adopted by African Heads of State.
In conclusion, Cameroon reaffirms its support for all reforms in progress aimed at revitalizing the General Assembly, strengthening the Economic and Social Council and streamlining the Secretariat, following the agenda adopted by the States Members of our Organization in order to consolidate its stature, its dimension and its capacity to better face the global challenges of our era."
Canada,CAN,North America,"  37,075,000 ",42969,6.340000153,7.2,82.315,Neoplasm,Cardiovascular Disease,Dementia,4417,11.91,"  37,075,000 ",100.00,11.72,"I am speaking here for the first time as Canada’s Foreign Minister as we gather in the Assembly Hall on the traditional territory of the Lenape people.
The Secretary-General has said that we are in rough seas; that a winter of global discontent is on the horizon; that we have a duty to act. I agree with him. From Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine and the impacts around the world, to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, to climate change, to severe the conflicts and hardships that now affect billions of people, the challenges we are facing are immense. These crises and the way we choose to respond to them are testing our shared commitment to the United Nations.
That is why our decisions matter more than ever. We have a choice — either we respect and defend the rules that we, collectively, have developed for generations and that have given us the longest period of peace in modern history, or we accept that rules can be broken by the powerful, bringing us back to darker times of constant tensions and conflicts, with massive displacements, suffering and losses of human lives.
For Canada, the choice is clear. We are convinced that we need more multilateralism, not less. We need more of the United Nations, not less. We need a United Nations that is effective, efficient, relevant and accountable. Throughout its history, Canada has strived to act as an honest broker, ready to build bridges between nations and differing points of view. We have worked tirelessly over the years to conceive, develop and strengthen the international system that we now know. We will continue to do so, and we will do it with all United Nations Members.
Last week, the Canadian delegation, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, met with leaders and civil society members from around the world. Canada has been listening, and we hear them. Many described and condemned Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine as brutal, illegal and unjustified — as a violation of the Charter of the United Nations. We agree with them. Many described the uneven recovery from the global
COVID-19 pandemic not only as incompatible with simple fairness, but also as a danger to public health. Again, we agree with them. They shared profound concern that the that achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals is at risk. And we agree we must address that head on. People from all corners of the globe clearly said that climate change is no longer on the horizon. It is here, and it is hitting the most vulnerable the hardest. That is undeniable.
The hearts of all Canadians go out to those affected by the devastating floods in Pakistan, as well as to our fellow citizens who found themselves in the destructive path of Hurricane Fiona.
Many conversations this week have focused on the harsh fact that more people are displaced by conflict and violence today than at any point in human history. I heard unmistakable appeals for accountability, including for the victims of Ukraine International Airlines flight 752 . Women and girls described their need to have control over their own futures and their own bodies, which is their right. Brave individuals shared deeply personal testimonies of their painful experiences of sexual violence in conflict. We believe them.
Such violence is unacceptable, and it must change. We must empower survivors in leading the path to their recovery and support them in the pursuit of meaningful justice, freedom of speech, disinformation and misinformation, the protection of minorities, the rule of law, and respect for science, facts and evidence. Powerful statements have been made on those issues this week. They speak to an erosion of civic space and democratic dialogue. Canada hears them. We do not come to these discussions with easy fixes. We have come to listen, to engage and to share our commitment to responding to this moment in a positive way, with purpose and in a spirit of global solidarity.
The world has heard horrible stories of Ukrainians losing loved ones to this outrageous, senseless war. The Assembly has spoken clearly and with conviction that Russia’s aggression against Ukraine violates the United Nations Charter. It strikes at the heart of the commitments we all made in building the Organization from the ashes of the Second World War. Rather than abide by the Assembly’s decisions and a legally binding order from the International Court of Justice, Russia has doubled down, including with a desperate effort to justify the unjustifiable. While the world gathered here in New York to pursue solutions for the greatest challenges of our time, President Putin informed us that he will conscript more young people into his war of choice. He threatened our collective security with reckless and dangerous nuclear rhetoric. For Putin, this is a war to the death. For Ukraine, this is a war for life.
Russia’s war machine has caused enormous civilian suffering and destruction in Ukraine. The mass graves discovered in Izyum are the latest demonstration of Putin’s utter disregard for human life. The impacts of this illegal war are profoundly felt around the world. We must address the global food security crisis and other consequences of the illegal invasion with imagination and determination. And those who break the law must be met with the force of the law. A permanent seat on the Security Council is not a license to kill or to silence anyone, and it should never guarantee impunity.
We are facing major crises: the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, conflict. Crises that were once the exception are now the rule. These crises are putting a strain on our ability to meet the targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We need a strong push to change the course of things. An urgent, global rescue effort is needed. We must rally and work together for the common good. The only possible path for Canada and the world is through the implementation of our Sustainable Development Goals.
From an economic point of view, we still have a lot to do to achieve true equality between Member States. We have listened carefully to what our partners and friends in the countries of the South have told us. We hear their message very clearly — the international financial institutions must be reformed. They must be able to adapt to today’s crises. Canada has stepped up to the challenge. No country should be left behind. We will work hard with our partners for a fair and equitable reform of the international financial system. Equity is at stake, but so are peace and world stability.
The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed the lives of nearly 6.5 million people around the world. Canada is committed to ending the pandemic and preventing others. Together, we will continue the fight against HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. Last week, Prime Minister Trudeau pledged $1.2 billion to support these efforts.
Let us now talk about climate change. We must act with the same sense of urgency demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Science tells us that we need to do more, faster. Hurricane Fiona, which hit several islands in the West Indies and eastern Canada, is just the latest example. From the Arctic to small island States, climate change poses an existential threat, and we experience its effects every day.
Canada is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2030, and then to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. We have a credible plan for get there. Canada will be participating in the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Egypt, and we look forward to welcoming the world to my home in Montreal for the fifteenth Meeting of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, under the chairmanship of China. Our priority is to ensure the success of the Conference, where we will work together to reverse the alarming loss of animal and plant species. Our own survival is at stake.
There are no simple solutions to the challenges we face, but it is obvious that to isolate oneself, to disregard the rule of law and to silence people is the opposite of progress. And yet some countries restrict civil liberties, violate human rights and massively monitor their populations. That tendency towards authoritarianism is most worrying. That phenomenon is particularly visible in the region of the Xinjiang, China. To that end, the publication of the United Nations report on human rights is an essential step. Its findings reflect credible accounts of abuses constituting crimes against humanity.
Canada is concerned about the repression of human rights that we have witnessed in several countries. The universality of human rights is well known. These human rights are universal in nature. We cannot therefore hide behind pretexts of national sovereignty in order to violate them. There are limits to defending the indefensible. We believe that democracy, although imperfect, remains the best system for protecting human rights and advancing sustainable development. All of our democracies face challenges. At home as elsewhere, we have to deal with apathy, anxiety and distrust of our institutions.
Canada is also committed to combating systemic racism and we continue to take concrete steps to pursue the path of reconciliation with indigenous peoples. In 2017, Prime Minister Trudeau gave a speech to the Assembly and spoke of our own legacy of colonialism in Canada (see A/72/PV.12). We are working tirelessly to remedy that dark chapter in our history, and we know that the full participation of indigenous peoples is fundamental to building a more just world.
The equality of women and girls in all their diversity is critical to peace, justice and prosperity. Like many countries, Canada is proud to have a feminist foreign policy. Together, we are building a global coalition in support of equality. That is how we will repel the growing attacks on women’s rights and freedoms.
In Afghanistan, the Taliban prevents women and girls from going to school. In Myanmar, courageous women who loudly demand the return of the democratic system are imprisoned by the military junta, tortured and subjected to horrific acts of sexual violence.
In Iran, women protesting the death of Mahsa Amini are met with arrest and bullets. We salute their courage and join them in sending a strong message that women’s rights are human rights. Today our Prime Minister announced that we will sanction those responsible, including Iran’s so-called morality police and its leadership.
From the Sudan to Haiti to Canada, women peacebuilders, human rights defenders and activists are being targeted. We must continue to speak up for the rights of women and girls and to support, protect, recognize and include women peacebuilders. We must also relentlessly pursue accountability for sexual violence. We will continue to push for justice for Rohingya women. And we will not rest until those responsible for sexual violence committed in Ukraine are held to account.
The Charter of the United Nations enshrines “faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women”. Yet we are seeing increasing violence, the widening crackdown on rights and freedoms, and the exclusion of women and girls from the negotiating table, the boardroom and the classroom. The sexual and reproductive health rights of women and girls are being rolled back or denied into too many countries. None of that by accident. These are deliberate choices.
To all the women in this Hall and around the world, I say: We hear you and Canada will always stand up for your right to choose. We will fight your full, equal, and meaningful participation in all walks of life. We will speak up for your rights and dignity. No Government, no politician, no judge and no one can take that away from you.
I have said that more than ever, the world needs more multilateralism; more of the United Nations, not less. To that end, we must restore trust among Member States. The crises we are facing have shown both the strengths and weaknesses of the structures we built nearly 80 years ago. We have been able to respond to the most serious hardships with compassion and effectiveness, but we can do better.
Political paralysis and the abuse of the veto are undermining the Security Council. We encourage efforts to reduce the power of the veto, to expand membership and to ensure that the voices of all are heard and responded to across the whole United Nations system.
United Nations peace operations also demand our efforts. Today peacekeeping faces immense challenges. Canada has long contributed to United Nations efforts to reduce conflict, and we will continue to do so. Engagement with the United Nations is a core commitment of Canadians. We were there at the United Nations creation, and today we are more engaged than ever. We will always engage with candour and directness, because we do not equate diplomacy with deception or global politics with global platitudes.
The United Nations Charter begins with the words, “We the peoples of the world”. We must remember that the fate of billions of people alive today and of those yet to be born is at stake in the work we do. We owe them our best efforts of heart, mind and soul. We can meet the test that time and circumstance have placed before us with hope, with courage and with a commitment to acting for our citizens today and for future generations to follow."
Chad,TCD,Africa,"  15,478,000 ",2192,5.886000156,4.5,53.977,Neoplasm,Cardiovascular Disease,Dementia,1027,6.64,"  1,714,981 ",11.08,2.83,"At the outset, I congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy- seventh session and wish him every success in conducting its work. I also pay tribute to Mr. Abdulla Shahid, the outgoing President of the General Assembly, for the dynamism with which he led the work of the seventy-sixth session. I further commend Secretary- General Antonio Guterres and wish him every success at this difficult time of multiple and complex crises throughout the world. We reiterate to him Chad’s full friendship and support.
The seventy-seventh session, whose theme is “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, is taking place at a time when humankind is facing a multitude of challenges unprecedented since the creation of our Organization. They are serious, complex and successive challenges to our collective efforts and difficult to address. The current international order, based on the Charter of the United Nations, is being severely tested, for instance, by the geopolitical tensions in several parts of our planet, including those caused by the ongoing war in Ukraine, with its impact on the affected civilian populations and on the entire world at the economic, food security and energy supply levels.
One of the difficult experiences we have faced was the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic that plunged our lives into a state of great upheaval. Today the world is struggling to recover from the shock of COVID-19. We have lived through that unprecedented challenge, enduring the loss of millions of human lives and its adverse health, social and economic consequences. The recent lull in the situation should not lead us to relax; rather, it should prompt us to further consolidate the multilateral cooperation we witnessed when States and organizations came together and supported each other to overcome the scourge. We hope to see a further consolidation of that multilateral cooperation, particularly in addressing other persistent and recurrent crises and challenges such as wars, terrorism, climate change, health and food crises and poverty.
This session is therefore an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and to reiterate our collective commitment to realizing them, in particular through the implementation of the recommendations made in the declaration on the commemoration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations (resolution 75/1). The time has come to take practical measures to achieve those objectives by correcting the many mistakes that have led to the recurrent problems hindering the work of the international community and preventing the full realization of the promises contained in the Charter.
In that regard, the Secretary-General’s Our Common Agenda initiative, which is an action plan aimed at strengthening and accelerating the implementation of multilateral agreements, in particular the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and making a concrete difference in the lives of people, is particularly welcome. It is indeed an important step in the right direction. Chad fully supports the initiative and hopes that it will lead to the promotion, strengthening and prioritization of multiple concrete solutions to the major challenges of our time and have a real impact on the lives of the people, particularly those in poor countries, rather than being a sham of multilateralism that is limited only to lengthy statements that have no real effect.
In that regard, it is clear that seven years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda and three years since its proclamation here in New York, the results of implementing the Sustainable Development Goals are still far from being achieved, especially for poor countries. As the Secretary-General’s reports on that issue have mentioned, those goals will not be met, and many people will be left behind, if bold action is not taken. Unfortunately, a downward spiral may be set off and cause disappointment in the hearts of millions of people around the world. That is why, in the wake of the declaration on the commemoration of the seventy- fifth anniversary of the United Nations, the Secretary- General’s Our Common Agenda initiative gives us hope that our legitimate expectations regarding international agreements and programmes, first and foremost the 2030 Agenda, can be realized.
All our actions converge towards sustainable development, but development is only possible where there is lasting peace and security. That is why the efforts of our States to achieve those objectives require increased and continuous support. The international commitments made to that effect through the 2030 Agenda, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the New Urban Agenda and all other international agendas must be honoured if we are to achieve the ultimate goal of ensuring that no one is left behind and having a planet that is fit to live on and can be passed on safely and proudly to succeeding generations.
To that end, in the face of mounting and accumulating challenges, it is crucial to strengthen the existing commitments made by virtue of the indispensable solidarity that binds our States together, especially the rich and the poor, through development assistance, on the one hand, and the implementation of economic and financial empowerment mechanisms, as well as sustainable development policies in favour of the least developed and landlocked developing countries, on the other.
Despite geopolitical emergencies and various constraints, any approach or attempt to limit development aid would be counterproductive and could increase crisis situations in the world. Chad therefore calls on donor countries to maintain and increase development assistance through the United Nations, which provides unlimited assistance to hundreds of millions of people around the world whose very survival depends on it.
I cannot but also mention the issue of debt, which continues to place an unbearable burden on many developing countries, including Chad. That burden constitutes a real problem, hampering post-COVID-19 recovery, economic recovery and the implementation of sustainable development programmes. Debt relief therefore remains an urgent need to promote economic recovery in low-income countries and reverse the gloomy outlook for the global economy. From that perspective, Chad reiterates its commitment to the various needs and initiatives to cancel or restructure the debt of developing countries. I also want to call for the swift implementation of the facilities granted to my country, Chad, within the framework of the initiatives that various multilateral bodies have taken in order to enable us to respond to the pressing needs of our people, who already face the accumulating challenges of economy, humanitarian emergencies, insecurity caused by terrorist threats, the negative effects of climate change, the food crisis and others.
Regarding the political situation in my country, as the General Assembly knows, we have been undergoing a period of political transition since 20 April 2021. I can tell everyone now that the transitional process is progressing satisfactorily. The Transitional Military Council, headed by General Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno, and the Transitional Government, are committed to ending that process and achieving lasting peace leading to rebuilding the Chadian State awaited by the Chadian people. Our inclusive and sovereign national dialogue, which is now under way, should lead to the holding of democratic, free and transparent elections. The dialogue brings together all the nation’s active forces and ensures the participation of political and military movements, made possible thanks to the Doha agreement signed on 8 August.
I take this opportunity to express from this rostrum the deep gratitude of the Government and the people of Chad to the Government of the State of Qatar, headed by His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad A1 Thani, Amir of the State of Qatar, who kindly hosted and facilitated the pre-dialogue between the Government of Chad and the political and military groups. The inclusive and sovereign national dialogue, in which all segments of the Chadian society participate — including political parties, civil society, politicians, military staff, professional organizations, women, youth, people with special needs, expatriates, civil and religious leaders, defence and security forces and others — is a historic opportunity for Chadians to decide, in full sovereignty, how to rebuild their country.
Participants in the dialogue have discussed all issues related to the future of Chad in complete honesty, freedom and sovereignty. The outcome of the dialogue will be implemented and binding on all. Chad is counting on its partners to support and finance the implementation of the dialogue’s ensuing decisions and recommendations. Of course, some have opted not to take part in that historic dialogue. Endeavours are being undertaken to persuading those brothers and sisters to reconsider their choice and join the dialogue.
In terms of security and development, the situation in the Sahel and the Lake Chad region has become extremely worrisome and continues to deteriorate due to many factors, including institutional changes in many countries of the region, the dismantling of military counter-terrorism units, the effects of climate change leading to increased food insecurity due to the lack of an appropriate response, uncontrolled illegal migration and unchecked growth in illicit trafficking.
With regard to the security situation, we note the resurgence of terrorist activities in the Sahel, which has been relentless in its spread to neighbouring regions in West Africa, especially Togo, Burkina Faso and Benin, where terrorist attacks have taken place. In the light of the continued deterioration of the situation, Chad has continuously called for a new approach to the situation in the Sahel so as to better adapt our responses.
In that regard, Chad welcomes the initiative of the United Nations and the African Union, in partnership with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel) to conduct a joint strategic assessment of the situation in the Sahel and the appointment of the former President of the Niger, His Excellency Mr. Mahamadou Issoufou, to head the Independent High-level Panel on Security and Development in the Sahel, responsible for conducting the assessment. We have no doubt that President Issoufou and his team will carry out an in-depth analysis of the problems plaguing the subregion and propose solutions to help us readapt the response to a multidimensional crisis that, despite the solutions already implemented, continues to deteriorate year after year.
It is true that the Sahel does not lack strategies or plans to address the crisis. The States of the Sahel and their bilateral and multilateral partners have implemented measures that have been in place for almost 20 years, with results that have fallen short of our expectations. The strategic assessment will therefore enable us to understand the causes, although we already know that the terrorism which is spilling blood in the Sahel cannot be defeated without the restoration of peace and State authority in Libya.
The many initiatives adopted by Member States at the national and subregional levels continue to suffer greatly from the lack of adequate resources for their implementation. The G-5 Sahel Joint Force, for example, is struggling to find sustainable and predictable resources to carry out its activities adequately. That is why Chad once again calls on its partners to support the G-5 Sahel in order to prevent the region from plunging deeper into violence and chaos. I reiterate the call of the G-5 Sahel Heads of State for sustainable and predictable funding from United Nations assessed contributions for the Joint Force.
With regard to the internal situation of the G-5 Sahel, it has seen the withdrawal of the sisterly Republic of Mali. We regret that withdrawal, as Mali was a founding member of the organization. Its place will be preserved. We will not be able to defeat terrorism or achieve stability and development in the Sahel unless we all join the struggle and pool our capabilities. We hope that our Malian brothers will reconsider their decision and rejoin our joint organization. The door of the G-5 Sahel remains wide open to them.
With regard to the situation in Libya, Chad is concerned about the persistence of the political impasse related to the clashes that took place in Tripoli on 26 and 27 August. Chad once again urges the Libyan political actors to prioritize dialogue in order to end the ongoing crisis and continue implementing the agreed elections agenda. Chad encourages the international community, in particular the United Nations and the African Union, to pursue efforts to bring the positions of the various parties to the conflict closer together and foster political dialogue, as the Libyan crisis will be resolved only through peaceful means and a Libyan-led inclusive political dialogue.
The persistence of the conflict in Libya poses a permanent threat to neighbouring countries and the entire Sahel region, for which Chad has paid and continues to pay a heavy price. In that regard, Chad once again reiterates its call on the Security Council and the Secretary-General to implement the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process, which represents a lasting solution to the issue of its nationals engaged with the various Libyan military factions.
With regard to Cuba, Chad calls for the lifting of the economic and trade embargo imposed by the United States Government on that country, which continues to weigh heavily on the lives of its people.
Concerning the reform of the Security Council—the organ responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security — Chad once again urges Member States to move from talk to action on implementing that reform and lifting the historical injustice against the African continent, which excludes it from full and fair participation in that organ. In that regard, Chad will continue to fully support the Common African Position, as set forth in the Sirte Declaration and other relevant conventions.
In conclusion, I wish the General Assembly every success in carrying out its tasks."
Chile,CHL,South America,"  18,729,000 ",21446,6.960000038,6.4,80.042,Neoplasm,Cardiovascular Disease,Dementia,1700,9.08,"  18,729,000 ",100.00,9.41,"It is an honour for me to be here among Member States at the General Assembly for the first time. I come from Chile, which is a beautiful country located in the extreme south of Latin America between the Andes Mountains, the backbone of our continent, and the majestic and imposing Pacific Ocean. It is a country that has a varied geography and stirring landscapes, where the clearest skies coexist with the stormiest seas and the driest desert with cities carved by rain.
As some of those present perhaps know, the Chilean people are hard-working and supportive. Thanks to their efforts, in just over two centuries we have gone from being Spain’s poorest colony in Latin America to being an independent, free, sovereign and thriving country, which today, with its tremendous opportunities, is on the threshold of comprehensive development, and we are working to ensure that this is for everyone and not just for a few. Chile has copper and lithium for electromobility and is a developing innovative corridor country, promoting clean energy to the world, with long coasts and protected marine areas to safeguard the environment and with top-level universities to foster and share knowledge.
I have come to tell colleagues that Chile needs the world, and that the world also needs Chile. But as Member States know and as has been clear in the addresses before mine, we live in a time of deep uncertainty and upheavals, in which it is clear that there is no nation among all those represented here that is isolated from, or immune to, shocks and what is happening globally. Our country is certainly no exception. The unfair war of aggression that Russia unleashed on Ukraine, with whose people we express our solidarity, pushed up fuel prices and caused shortages of grains and fertilizers, with a strong impact on our economy and that of many States. In addition, while it is harder to talk about, the trade war between the United States and China, unleashed under the Trump Administration in 2018, as well as the pandemic destabilized the global economy, affecting our economy as well as that of other Member States.
At another level, the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, as a result of its already prolonged political crisis, has generated an unprecedented migratory flow in our region and our country, putting tremendous pressure on our institutions and society.
Finally, as many Member States are clearly experiencing, the climate crisis has a particularly strong impact on our Latin American continent, and especially the Caribbean, as well as the livelihoods of our people. In Chile, we meet seven of the nine vulnerability criteria established by the United Nations: low-level coastal areas, arid and semi-arid areas, forests, propensity to natural disasters, droughts, polluted urban areas and fragile mountain ecosystems. However, our country, no doubt like many Member States present and a large part of the global South, produces and is responsible for a tiny share — in our case 0.24 per cent — of global greenhouse-gas emissions, while the countries with the biggest economies, the Group of 20, as the Secretary-General recalled, produce 80 per cent of greenhouse-gas emissions. As is evident, these days no country, whether big or small, weak or powerful, can expect to save itself on its own.
While we were preparing this speech, I was thinking about how, among so many clearly interesting statements regarding the specific reality of each country, we could contribute a grain of sand to the building of the fairest possible world. Aware of the fact I am not the one to give lessons on each of the problems of the turbulent world in which we live, I thought that relating our recent experience as a country could help those who want to listen to learn from it.
Chile is currently undergoing an intense political process. Almost three years ago, we faced a serious political and social crisis. During those days, a great majority of Chileans expressed their unease about the inequality and mistreatment, their indignation at the long waits for public health care, their disgust at the millions of dollars in student debts and their rejection
of meagre pensions after long years of work. That is perhaps a familiar story for many of those here.
In a few months, it will be 50 years since President Salvador Allende, from this very rostrum where I have the honour to be today, gave an account of the important social and political changes that our country was undergoing (see A/PV.2096). We are a country that has long been searching for its own path to dignity. While poverty has been significantly reduced and there has been significant progress on social issues during the democratic Governments of the past 30 years, it is undeniable that the development model adopted in Chile has preserved a high degree of wealth, making us one of the most unequal countries in the world, which grieves us.
As clearly also happens in many developing countries, that inequality has not only hindered our path to development but is also a potential threat to democracy, since the fracture in society destroys social cohesion, thereby hampering our understanding of each other and our building together a freer and fairer future.
The social upheaval that Chile experienced in 2019 perplexed many observers, including some represented here, who were asking what had happened in the country, as well as actors in national life. Many were struck by the fact that a country that had achieved significant levels of economic growth and human development, showing significant improvements in the quality of life of its population, was at the same time faced with such a profound crisis.
Unfortunately, what happened in my homeland was not accidental, but the consequence of countless stories of pain and procrastination that were brewing and affecting the very heart of our society. I want to say that, even if it is not expected, that can also happen in the countries of other Member States. That is why I ask that we, together, be proactive in the pursuit of greater social justice. A better distribution of wealth and power must go hand in hand with sustainable growth. I am deeply convinced that, with the participation of Member States, it is possible, and it is an urgent need.
Regrettably, I must say this today because each of us cannot come and just talk about good things. That discontent also expressed itself in serious incidents of violence, such as fires in metro stations and the vandalization of civic buildings.
Meanwhile, we witnessed uncontrolled repression, which resulted in deaths, injuries and more than 400 people suffering eye injuries as a result of the State’s action, which, in the view of our Government and various international organizations, represents a serious human rights violation that must be redressed, and it will be.
It was that long history of injustice that manifested itself in our country from October to December 2019. But — and this is the good news — history lasts longer than those of us who today hold these positions and the long history of citizen mobilization and social struggles, which enabled the return to democracy and the reunion of democrats, as President Aylwin said at the end of the previous century, and which at the dawn of the twentieth century allowed progress in workers’ rights. In the peaceful protests of 2019, there were also women from the previous century who, despite everything, advanced women’s right to vote. The memories of the workers who achieved the right to rest and the settlers who fought, and continue to fight, for decent housing accompanied us. All those memories and social struggles were present.
The values behind that deep discontent — equality, justice and freedom — are not unrelated to a demand that we see increasingly frequently around the world and from this rostrum. The protection and promotion of human rights everywhere and by every Government, decent work, universal social protection and the fight against the climate crisis are today universal demands that are the focus of Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), led by our Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, and the Sustainable Development Goals.
The way forward for a peaceful and democratic solution to the crisis in our country was an important agreement between the main political forces that developed a path towards the drafting of a new constitution, capable of laying the foundations of a new social contract. That path, driven by Chilean society from protest and social struggle and politically channelled by various institutions, was endorsed by a plebiscite, where 80 per cent of voters supported a new constitution, to be written by a specifically elected body.
The challenge is not a small one. It consists of achieving, as never before in our history, a democratic constitution, drafted with the participation of citizens and indigenous peoples and gender parity — a constitution for all, but also made by all.
A few weeks ago, the work accomplished by the Constitutional Convention between 2021 and 2022 was submitted to citizen consultation by means of a plebiscite, in which Chileans participated on a massive scale, with 85 per cent participation. In that electoral event, we citizens clearly rejected the proposal by 62 per cent versus 38 per cent. Today, as a country, we are therefore looking for new formulas to build this meeting place for all Chileans.
My personal decision in the plebiscite was to vote for the proposal for a new constitution, but the result was the opposite. Some saw the result of the plebiscite as a defeat for the Government. In all humility, I wish to say to them today at the United Nations that a Government can never feel defeated when the people speak out. In a democracy, the people’s word is sovereign and is the guide at all times.
Why am I talking about this? Because, unlike in the past, when differences in Chile were resolved by blood and fire, today we Chileans agree to overcome our challenges democratically.
I am talking about this because I am sure that one of the main challenges for humankind today is building democracies that truly speak and listen to the people and achieve the desired results. Those of us attending this Assembly have the duty to improve our democracies.
Ms. Kamina Johnson Smith (Jamaica),
Vice-President, took the Chair.
During the many days of mobilization, the word dignity resounded. The Chilean people expressed themselves, giving us a lesson in democracy, which we are learning. Chile has called on its democracy and its political actors to rise to their demands and the challenges of today, which we too must meet.
As a Government, we received the results of the recent plebiscite with our eyes and hearts wide open. We want to hear what the people are telling us because we trust in their judgment and their will. There are things that we understood very clearly, which I want to briefly share. The results are the expression of a citizenry that demands changes without jeopardizing its current achievements and that wants a better future, built seriously and without succumbing to new insecurities — a future of change with stability.
As a young person who not long ago was protesting on the street, I can say that representing unrest is much easier than providing solutions for it. Those of us devoted to the demanding work of politics often easily confuse our successes as spokespeople for citizen annoyance with our real capacity to be builders of better futures. The outcome of our country’s plebiscite has taught us to be humbler — democracy should be humble — and to realize that, in building the Chile of which we dream, no given sector has the recipe. Rather, it is a mixture, combining the best that each of us can contribute. In the twenty-first century, we govern by mobilizing the capacities and wisdom of our societies, not by trying to replace them.
As President of Chile, I am convinced that very soon Chile will have a constitution that satisfies us and makes us proud, built on democracy that brings together the contributions of all sectors of society and is able to reflect our aspirations for justice and liberty.
From the humble history of my country, I can say with deep conviction that the path to overcoming the problems that afflict our societies is paved with more democracy, not with less, encouraging, and not limiting, participation, fostering dialogue, never censoring it, and, above all, respecting those who think differently, including their points of view and understanding that having different opinions does not make us enemies. I rebel against the chasm that some try to dig around legitimately diverse views. We in Chile declare our will to be builders of bridges across such gaps, which prevent us from seeing ourselves as diverse societies.
That is the experience and learning that, from our small country, we want to share with the nations of the world. Deepening democracy is an ongoing exercise, in which we can only persevere and each learn from the experience of others.
In conclusion, I therefore call on Member States to work together to strengthen democracy in all spaces, in every country and in relations among us. In Latin America, we need a united voice and more common work by the global South. We need a modernized United Nations, where we all have the same goals,
Based on multilateralism, justice and peace at all times and in all places, we must commit to taking the necessary actions, not just making statements, so as to stop Russia’s unjust war on Ukraine and put an end to all abuses by the powerful everywhere in the world. We must commit to mobilizing our efforts to stop violence against women, be it in Iran in memory of Mahsa Amini, who died at the hands of the police this week, or anywhere in the world. We must
commit to not normalizing the ongoing human rights violations against the Palestinian people by upholding international law and the resolutions adopted by this very Assembly that support their inalienable right to establish their own free, sovereign State, as well as to ensuring Israel’s legitimate right to live within secure and internationally recognized borders. We must commit to continuing to work for the release of political prisoners in Nicaragua and to ensure that nowhere in the world can having ideas that differ from those of the Government in power end in persecution or human rights violations.
The whole world is calling for change and, like those before us, we, as part of the new generations, have the right and responsibility to think about and realize a different future. Citizens who suffer the most from the consequences of societies built on segregation and abuse demand rights and a safe life. We can achieve that world of greater well-being only through increased democracy. That is the call that today we must all heed. In Chile, we are ready to collaborate in every part of the world to that end.

China,CHN,Asia,"  1,427,648,000 ",12320,4.675000191,5.1,76.704,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Chronic Respiratory Disease,116324,8.15,"  1,427,648,000 ",100.00,9.27,"We are at a time fraught with challenges. The coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) keeps resurfacing. Global security faces uncertainty. Global economic recovery is fragile and unsteady, and various risks and crises are emerging. The world has entered a new phase of turbulence and transformation. Changes unseen in a century are accelerating.
But we are also at a time full of hope. The world continues to move toward multipolarity, economic globalization is deepening and our societies are becoming increasingly digitized and culturally diversified. Countries are becoming ever more interconnected and interdependent. Peace and development remain the underlying trend of our times. Around the world, the people’s call for progress and cooperation is getting louder that ever before.
How should we respond to the call of our times and ride the trend of history to build a community with a shared future for humankind? China’s answer is firm and clear.
First, we must uphold peace and oppose war. Chinese President Xi Jinping notes that peace, like air and sunshine, is hardly noticed when we are benefiting from it, but none of us can live without it. Peace is crucial for our future and it underpins the common security of all countries. Turbulence and war can only open a Pandora’s box, and he who instigates a proxy war can easily get himself burned. Pursuing one’s own absolute security can only undermine global strategic stability. We should remain committed to addressing differences by peaceful means and resolve disputes through dialogue and consultation.
Secondly, we must pursue development and eliminate poverty. Development holds the key to resolving difficult issues and delivering a happy life to our people. We should place development at the centre of the international agenda, build international consensus on promoting development, and uphold all countries’ legitimate right to development. We should foster new drivers for global development, forge a global development partnership and see that everyone in every country benefits more from the fruits of development in a more equitable way.
Thirdly, we must remain open and oppose exclusion. President Xi Jinping has pointed out that openness is the sure way to realize human prosperity and advancement. Protectionism can only boomerang and decoupling and supply chain disruption will hurt everyone. We should stay true to openness and inclusiveness and tear down fences and barriers that hinder the free flow of the factors of production. We should uphold the multilateral trading system, with the World Trade Organization at its core, and work to build an open world economy.
Fourthly, we must seek cooperation and oppose confrontation. As we face a host of global challenges that crop up one after another, our biggest strength will come from solidarity; our best strategy is to stick together, and the brightest future lies in win-win cooperation. It is only natural that countries have problems and differences among them, but they should increase mutual understanding on a basis of equality and respect. We should engage in dialogue, consultation and win-win cooperation, and reject conflict, coercion and zero-sum games. We should jointly oppose group politics and bloc confrontation.
Fifthly, we must strengthen solidarity and oppose division. President Xi once stated that countries around the world were like passengers aboard the same ship who shared a common stake. All of us passengers should pull together to navigate the ship through the storm towards a bright future. Our world must embrace diverse civilizations if it is to make continuous advances, and humankind must pursue an inclusive path if it is to achieve modernization. Peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom are common values of humanity. Differences in system should not be used as an excuse to create division; still less should democracy and human rights be used as tools or weapons to achieve political ends. We should stand against drawing lines on ideological grounds and make united efforts to expand common ground to promote world peace and development.
Sixthly, we must uphold equity and oppose bullying. Mutual respect and the equality of countries big and small are primary principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Major international issues should be handled by all countries, and international rules drawn up by all countries together. No country is above others, and no country should wilfully abuse its power to bully other sovereign countries. We should advocate and practice true multilateralism, promote the equality of all countries in terms of rights, rules and opportunities, and build a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, equity and justice, and win-win cooperation.
China, as a permanent member of the Security Council and the world’s largest developing country,
is committed to solidarity and cooperation with other countries. It will follow the trend of the times and pursue the shared interests of the vast majority of countries.
China is a builder of world peace. We have actively promoted international peace and participated in the international arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation process. China is the top contributor of peacekeeping personnel among the permanent members of the Security Council and the second largest funding contributor to both the United Nations and its peacekeeping operations. China is the only country in the world that pledges to keep to a path of peaceful development in its Constitution. It is the only one among the five nuclear-weapon States that is committed to no first use of nuclear weapons. It has thereby made an important contribution to global strategic stability.
In response to various security challenges facing the world, President Xi proposed the Global Security Initiative. He called on the international community to pursue common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, to abide by the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, to take the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously, to peacefully resolve disputes through dialogue and consultation, and to maintain security in both traditional and non-traditional domains, thus contributing China’s wisdom to reducing the peace deficit facing humankind and providing China’s input to meeting global security challenges.
China has been a contributor to global development. We have endeavoured to build a system of high-standard opening-up and to safeguard the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains. China is a major trading partner of over 130 countries and regions. Contributing about 30 per cent of annual global growth, China is the biggest engine driving the global economy. China is a pacesetter in implementing the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It has met the poverty-reduction goal 10 years ahead of schedule and accounts for over 70 per cent of the gains in global poverty reduction. China is also an active participant in global governance and South-South cooperation. It took the initiative to set up the China- United Nations Peace and Development Trust Fund and the Global Development and South-South Cooperation Fund. It has provided development aid to more than 160 countries in need and extended more debt-service payments owed by developing countries than any other State member of the Group of 20.
At the seventy-sixth session of the General Assembly, President Xi proposed the Global Development Initiative. Putting people front and centre, the Initiative is a rallying call to refocus global attention on development and build a global community of development. At the recent High-level Dialogue on Global Development, President Xi announced dozens of major concrete steps to implement the Initiative, generating a strong impetus for accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. On the margins of this session of the General Assembly, China has hosted a ministerial meeting of the Group of Friends of the Global Development Initiative, renewing the consensus on pursuing the Initiative. As China forges ahead, its fast train of development will continue to drive global growth and deliver more benefits to the people of all countries.
China has been a defender of the international order. We are committed to upholding the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, the international system with the United Nations at its core and the international order based on international law. China has been involved in multilateral affairs in all fields. It is a member of almost all universal intergovernmental organizations and a party to over 600 international conventions. It has concluded more than 27,000 bilateral treaties and fulfilled its international obligations in good faith. China abides by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and has made relentless efforts to protect and strengthen its human rights. China is firmly against attempts to politicize human rights and has worked to advance the healthy development of international human rights cooperation.
As a member of the developing world, China will forever stand with other developing countries. We are heartened to see the rapid progress achieved by the developing world in recent years, and we will continue to speak up for other developing countries, help them overcome difficulties and fully support efforts to raising the representation and voice of developing countries in international affairs. Developing countries are no longer the silent majority in international and multilateral processes. With stronger solidarity, China and other developing countries have spoken out for justice and become a pillar of promoting development cooperation and safeguarding equity and justice.
China has been a provider of public goods. In the face of COVID-19, China has made all-out efforts to advance and engage in global cooperation against the virus. We have done our best to provide anti-COVID-19 supplies and shared our practices in COVID-19 response. China was among the first to promise to make COVID-19 vaccines a global public good and to support waiving intellectual property rights on the vaccines. China has provided over 2.2 billion doses of vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations.
In response to tough challenges confronting global development, President Xi has proposed to advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, an initiative that has been widely endorsed by the international community. China has signed cooperation documents with 149 countries and 32 international organizations. We have set up the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Silk Road Fund, thereby building the largest, broadest and most inclusive platforms for international cooperation.
In response to the shared concerns of various countries about data security, we have launched the Global Initiative on Data Security as a reference for formulating rules on global data security.
In response to climate change, China is committed to pursuing a development path of green and low-carbon growth that puts ecological conservation first. We announced the ambitious carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals and are working to implement the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. China accounts for one-fourth of all the trees planted globally. We are making unremitting efforts to foster a community of life for man and nature.
In response to global food security challenges, China has put forth a cooperation initiative on global food security. This year, we have provided over 15,000 tons of emergency humanitarian food assistance to other developing countries in need.
China has been a mediator of hotspot issues. As a responsible major country, China has explored workable Chinese approaches to solving hotspot issues. While adhering to the principle of non-interference in others’ domestic affairs and respecting the will and needs of the countries concerned, China has endeavoured to help settle hotspot issues in a constructive way. Our approach is to promote peace through talks that are fair and pragmatic and that seek to address both the symptoms and root causes of hotspot issues.
China supports all efforts conducive to the peaceful resolution of the Ukraine crisis. The pressing priority is to restore peace through talks. To achieve a fundamental solution, it is important to address the legitimate security concerns of all parties concerned and build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture. We call on all parties concerned to keep the crisis from spilling over and to protect the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries.
The Palestinian question is at the heart of the Middle East issue. Justice is already late in coming, but it must not be absent. The two-State solution is crucial to upholding fairness and justice. China will continue to support the Palestinian people as they pursue their just cause of restoring legitimate national rights.
To resolve the Korean peninsula nuclear issue, it is important to address its root cause. We need to follow the dual-track approach and the principle of taking phased and synchronized steps, jointly uphold peace and stability on the peninsula, and resolve the issue through dialogue and consultation.
Afghanistan is in a critical transition from chaos to order. The right way forward is to put in place an inclusive political framework and adopt moderate policies. The goal should be to resume economic growth and improve people’s lives. To achieve that goal, Afghanistan should combat terrorism and integrate itself into the region.
A small number of countries have arbitrarily imposed unilateral sanctions, cut off development aid and frozen the lawful assets of other countries. This is an unacceptable practice that must be corrected. China firmly supports the Cuban people in their just struggle to defend their sovereignty and oppose external interference and blockade.
The abuse of guns is becoming an increasingly serious problem across the world. In that regard, I want to announce that China has decided to launch its domestic procedure to ratify the Protocol Against the Illicit Manufacturing and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, a step that will contribute to strengthening global cooperation on gun control and closing the security deficit.
Since ancient times, Taiwan has been an inalienable part of China’s territory. China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity have never been severed and the fact that the mainland and Taiwan belong to one and the same China has never changed. All of us Chinese have never ceased in our efforts to realize reunification.
It is explicitly stated in the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, issued some 70 years ago, that all the territories Japan had stolen from the Chinese, including Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, shall be restored to China. That constitutes an important part of the post-war international order. Fifty-one years ago in this Hall, the General Assembly adopted resolution 2758 (XXVI) by an overwhelming majority, restoring the lawful seat of the People’s Republic of China in the United Nations and to expel the representatives of the Taiwan authorities from the place they had unlawfully occupied. The so-called dual representation proposal put forward by the United States and a few other countries to keep Taiwan’s seat in the United Nations became a piece of waste paper. Resolution 2758 (XXVI) resolved once and for all, politically, legally and procedurally, the issue of the representation of the whole of China, including Taiwan, in the United Nations and international institutions. It completely blocked any attempt by anyone or any country to create “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan”.
The one-China principle has become a basic norm in international relations and a general consensus in the international community. When entering into diplomatic relations with China, 181 countries all recognized and accepted that there is only one China in the world, Taiwan is a part of China, and the Government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal Government representing the whole of China. By firmly upholding the one-China principle, China is not only maintaining its sovereignty and territorial integrity, but also truly safeguarding peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and non-interference in others’ affairs, a basic norm of international relations that is of vital importance to the large number of developing countries.
China will continue to endeavour to achieve peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and greatest efforts. To that end, we must combat Taiwan independence separatist activities with the firmest resolve and take the most forceful steps to repel interference by external groups. Only by resolutely forestalling separatist activities in accordance with the law can we forge a true foundation for peaceful reunification. Only when China is completely reunified can there be enduring peace across the Taiwan Strait.
Any scheme to interfere in China’s internal affairs is bound to meet the strong opposition of all Chinese, and any move to obstruct China’s cause of reunification is bound to be crushed by the wheels of history.
The international community closely follows China’s development. Since the eighteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) convened 10 years ago, socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era. In the past decade, China has registered historic achievements and transformation in pursuing economic and social development. In this decade, it has also realized a historic leap in its relations with the world and made historic contributions to the international community.
China is fully implementing a new development philosophy of innovative, coordinated, green and open development for all, and is pursuing high- quality development and fostering a new development paradigm. With the strong leadership of the CPC, the concerted efforts of our 1.4 billion people, the strengths of socialism with Chinese characteristics, a solid foundation underpinning sustained rapid development, and strong confidence in achieving development through its own efforts, China will enjoy sustained and sound development, usher in even brighter prospects and make more splendid miracles come true.
With one-fifth of the global population, China’s march towards modernization has important, far- reaching significance for the world. The path that China pursues is one of peace and development, not one of plunder and colonialism; it is a path of win-win cooperation, not one of zero-sum game; and it is one of harmony between man and nature, not one of destructive exploitation of resources. We will continue to contribute our input to meeting the challenges facing human development, and make our contribution to creating a new form of human advancement.
Next month, the CPC will convene its twentieth National Congress in Beijing. The Congress will, in response to the expectation of all the Chinese people, set well-conceived goals and tasks for China’s development over the next five years and beyond, and draw up an overarching plan for China’s future development. Having reached a new historical starting point, China will follow the Chinese path to modernization to achieve its national rejuvenation. China will work with other countries to make every effort for peace and development, shoulder the responsibility for solidarity
and progress, build a community with a shared future for humankind, and embrace an even better world."
Colombia,COL,South America,"  49,661,000 ",12963,8.850000381,6.0,77.109,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Chronic Respiratory Disease,1965,3.96,"  49,661,000 ",100.00,8.62,"I come from one of the three most beautiful countries on Earth. There is an explosion of life there — thousands of multicoloured species in the seas, skies and lands. I come from the land of yellow butterflies and magic. Water cascades down the lush green mountains and valleys — but so do torrents of blood. I come from a country of blood-soaked beauty.
My country is both beautiful and violent. How can beauty co-exist with death? How can the biodiversity of life flourish alongside the dance of death and horror? Who is to blame for breaking the spell with terror? Who or what is responsible for burying our daily lives in routine decisions about wealth and interest? Who is leading us to destruction as a nation and a people?
My country is beautiful because it has the Amazon forest, the Choco Forest, the waters, the Andes Mountain range and the oceans. There, in those forests, planetary oxygen is generated and atmospheric carbon dioxide (C02) is absorbed. One of those C02-absorbing plants, among millions of species, is one of the most persecuted on Earth. Its destruction is being sought at any cost — it is an Amazonian plant, the coca plant, the sacred plant of the Incas.
As if at a paradoxical crossroads, the forest we are trying to save is at the same time being destroyed. To destroy the coca plant, they throw vast quantities of poisons and glyphosate into the water, they arrest the growers and imprison them. People who grow the coca plant are arrested and imprisoned. One million Latin Americans have been killed, and 2 million African- Americans are imprisoned in North America for destroying or possessing the coca leaf.
“Destroy the plant that kills”, they shout from the North, but the plant is only one of the millions that perish when they set the jungle on fire. Destroying the forest, the Amazon, has become the watchword of States and businesses. Never mind the scientists’ warning that the rainforest is one of the great pillars of the climate. For the global power networks, the forest and its inhabitants are to blame for the problems that beset them. The global power networks are at the mercy of their addiction to money, remaining in power, oil, cocaine and the hardest drugs available to numb themselves more.
There is nothing is more hypocritical than the debate about saving the forest. The forest is burning, while the members of the General Assembly make war and play with it. The forest — the pillar of our global climate — is disappearing with all its life. The great sponge that absorbs planetary C02 is evaporating. This life-saving forest is seen in my country as an enemy to be defeated, a weed to be eradicated. The space where peasants live and grow coca because they have nothing else to grow is being demonized.
The members of the General Assembly are interested in my country only if they can throw poison into its forests, put its men into prison and exile its women. They have no interest in our children’s education, they want to destroy our forest and extract coal and oil from its bowels. Our poison-absorbing sponge is of no use, they prefer to spread more poison into the atmosphere.
For the members of the General Assembly, we provide an excuse for the emptiness and loneliness of their own societies, which leads them to live in a drug bubble. We hide them from their problems, which they refuse to reform. It is better to declare war on the forests, on its plants, on its people. While they let the forest burn, while hypocrites pursue the plants with poison in order to hide the disasters of their own societies, they ask us for more and more coal, more and more oil in order to satisfy their other addiction — to consumption, to power, to money.
Which is more toxic to humankind — cocaine, coal or oil? The judgement of power has decreed that cocaine is a poison and must be persecuted, even if it only causes minimal deaths by overdose — more deaths are caused by contamination of the drug during its illicit trade. Meanwhile, they have declared that coal and oil must be protected, with the result that their use could lead to humankind’s extinction. That is the
state of world power, of injustice and of irrationality, because world power has become irrational. They see in the forest’s exuberance and vitality a lustfulness and sinfulness — the root cause of the sadness in their societies, which are steeped in the insatiable compulsion to have and to consume.
How can they hide the loneliness in people’s hearts, the emptiness of societies devoid of affection and competitive to the point of trapping people’s souls in loneliness, if not by blaming the plant, the people who grow it and the liberal secrets of the jungle? According to the irrational world Powers, it is not the market that is to blame for shortening humankind’s existence, but the forest and those who live in it.
The bank accounts have become unlimited, the savings of the most powerful people on Earth could not even be spent in centuries. The sadness of existence created by that artificial call for competition is filled with noise and drugs. The addiction to money and possessions has another side to it — addiction to drugs in people who lose the contest, in the artificial race into which they have transformed humankind.
The disease of loneliness will not be cured by spreading glyphosate in the forest. It is not the forest that is to blame. Those to blame are the societies trained to engage in endless consumption and into stupidly mistaking consumption for happiness, while filling the pockets of the powerful with money. The forest is not to blame for drug addiction — it is the irrational behaviour of the world Powers. Give them a dose of light, of reason. Turn the century’s lights back on.
The war on drugs has lasted 40 years. If we do not change course and it continues for another 40 years, the United States will see 2,800,000 young people die of overdose from fentanyl, a drug that Latin America does not produce. It will see millions of African-Americans incarcerated in private prisons. African-American prisoners will become a business venture for prison companies. One million more Latin Americans will be murdered, our waters and green fields will be filled with blood and the dream of democracy will die, both in my America and in Anglo-Saxon America. Democracy will die where it was born, in the great Athens of the European West.
If we hide the truth, we will see the forest and our democracies die. The war on drugs has failed. The fight against the climate crisis has failed.
Deadly drug use has increased, progressing from soft drugs to harder drugs. Genocide has been perpetrated on my continent, and in my country millions of people have been sent to prison — and they have blamed the forest and its plants in order to hide their own social guilt. They have filled their speeches and their policies with nonsense.
On behalf of my wounded Latin America, I call for an end to the irrational war on drugs. Reducing drug consumption does not require wars or weapons. It requires us all to build better societies — more caring, affectionate societies, in which the intensity of life protects us from addictions and new forms of slavery. Do the members of the General Assembly want fewer drugs? Let them think about less money, more love. Let them think about the rational exercise of power.
Let them not taint the beauty of my homeland with their poisons. Let them help us, without hypocrisy, to save the Amazon forest in order to ensure humankind’s existence on the planet. They brought the scientists together, who spoke with reason. Their mathematics and climatological models demonstrated that the end of the human species is near and that we no longer have millenniums — or even centuries — left. Science set the alarm bells ringing, and we stopped listening to them. War has served as an excuse for not taking the necessary measures.
When action was most needed, when speeches were no longer useful, when it was indispensable to deposit money into funds to save humankind, when it was necessary to move away as soon as possible from coal and oil — they invented one war after another. They invaded Ukraine, but also Iraq, Libya and Syria. They invaded in the name of oil and gas. In the twenty-first century, they discovered the worst of their addictions: money and oil. Wars have served for them as an excuse to not take action to combat the climate crisis and shown them how dependent they are on what will finish off the human species.
When the members of the General Assembly see starving and thirsty people migrating north by the millions, to where the water is, they enclose them, build walls, deploy machine guns and shoot at them. They expel them as if they were not human beings, five times worse than the mentality of those whose policies created the gas chambers and concentration camps. They have brought us back on a global scale to 1933 — the day of the great triumph of the assault on reason. Do they not
see that the solution to the great exodus unleashed on their countries is to bring back the flow of nutrients into the water that fills the rivers and fields?
The climate disaster fills us with viruses that spread devastation, but they do business with medicines and turn vaccines into commodities. They say that the market will save us from what the market itself created. Humankind, like Frankenstein, lets the market — and greed — act without planning, abandoning logic and reason. It subordinates human reason to greed. What is the point of war when what we need to do is save the human species? What is the point of NATO and empires when the end of intelligence is near?
The climate disaster will kill hundreds of millions of people, and the members of the General Assembly may be assured that it is not the planet but capital that will be to blame. The cause of the climate disaster is capital. The logic of relationships geared to consuming more and more and producing more and more so that some of us earn more and more is the cause of the climate disaster. They harnessed the logic of the expanded accumulation of capital to the use of coal- and petrol- fired engines, and they unleashed a hurricane: the chemical changes in our atmosphere will be more and more widespread and deadly. Now in a parallel word, the expanded accumulation of capital is the expanded accumulation of death.
From the land of forests and beauty — where they decided to make the Amazon forest the enemy and to extradite and imprison its farmers — I urge the members of the General Assembly to stop the war and put an end to the climate disaster. Here in the Amazon forest, humankind has failed. Behind the conflagrations burning there, behind the poisoning, lies the failure of humankind as a civilization. Behind the addiction to cocaine and drugs, behind the addiction to oil and coal, lies the real addiction of this current phase of human history: the addiction to irrational power, to profit and to money. That is the massive deadly machinery that could wipe out humankind.
As President of one of the most beautiful — and blood-drenched and exploited — countries on Earth, I call for an end to the war on drugs and for our people to be allowed to live in peace. I call on all of Latin America to come together with one voice in order to defeat the irrational behaviour that is making martyrs of our physical bodies. I call on the members of the General Assembly to save the entirety of the Amazon forest using resources that can be allocated worldwide to ensuring life.
For those members that do not have the capacity to finance the funding of the revitalization of the forests or for which it is harder to allocate money to life than to weapons, I call on them to reduce foreign debt in order to release our own budget spaces, through which the work of saving humankind and life on the planet can be undertaken. We can do it if they do not want to. Just exchange debt for life, for nature.
I call on all members of the General Assembly, and in particular I call on all Latin America, to engage in dialogue to end the war. Do not pressure us to take a side in the war. It is time for peace. Let the Slavic peoples talk to each other. Let the peoples of the world talk to each other.
War is only a trap that brings us all closer to the end of time in our great orgy of irrationality. On behalf of Latin America, we call on Ukraine and Russia to make peace.
Only in peace can we save lives on this Earth of ours. There can be no total peace without social, economic and environmental justice. We are also at war with the planet. If there is no peace with the planet, there will be no peace among nations. And without social justice, there is no social peace."
Comoros,COM,Africa,"  832,000 ",1713,4.34100008,4.0,64.118,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Lower Respiratory Infection,46,5.53,"  721,653 ",86.74,5.13,"At the outset, I would like to warmly congratulate His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid on his effective leadership of the work of the seventy-sixth session of our Assembly. I also wish to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi, his successor, on his brilliant election and to assure him of the solidarity of the Comoros as he carries out his mission. I also thank Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his sustained investment, as well as that of all his teams, in the service of peace and development.
The seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly is being held at a particularly delicate moment in the life of the international community. The face of the world is changing profoundly from one year to the next. Indeed, three years ago our countries entered the worst health crisis in their history, marked by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The pandemic, as the Assembly knows, has brought all the countries of the world to their knees and demonstrated that, big or small, we are all equal in the face of the epidemiological threat that today is one of the worst situations facing our global village. In that regard, the Union of the Comoros wishes once again to express its thanks and appreciation to all those who have worked tirelessly to provide, in just a few months, effective solutions that make it possible to restore hope in the world and to gradually emerge from this crisis that has seriously shaken the world’s economies.
As if all that were not enough, another crisis, caused by the invasion of Ukraine, has revealed once again, and in a dramatic way, the fragility of the multilateral system that brings us together today. With each passing day we are seeing the price of wheat and other food products increase to unprecedented levels, which jeopardizes food security by increasing the threats of shortage and famine. That is why my country condemns in the strongest terms this anachronistic invasion and urges the international community to convince Russia and Ukraine to resume as soon as possible the path of dialogue and mutual respect, the only things capable of opening the way to the cessation of hostilities. I would also like to welcome last July’s Black Sea Grain Initiative, carried out under the auspices of President
Erdogan of Tiirkiye and Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and aimed at allowing the export of millions of tons of grain blocked in Ukrainian ports. Those agreements, which ought to be consolidated, are proof that dialogue can and must always prevail to prevent the world from plunging into chaos and misery.
In addition to concerns related to the ongoing conflicts and health and food crises, the community of nations must continue its quest for appropriate solutions to political and territorial problems related to the sovereignty of States and the dignity of nations. In that respect, I reiterate here, on behalf of my delegation, the imperative need to find a rapid, just and equitable solution to the flagrant injustice that Palestine is suffering. We must indeed find a solution that enshrines the right of the Palestinian people to a sovereign State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living in perfect security and harmony with the State of Israel because, as the Comorian adage says, “we choose our friends, but we do not choose our neighbours”.
With regard to the question of the Moroccan Sahara, I reiterate the unfailing support of the Union of the Comoros for the principle of Moroccan rule over the Sahara. The Moroccan autonomy initiative, within the framework of the sovereignty of the Cherifian Kingdom, is, in our eyes, the best basis for reaching a timely, pragmatic and lasting solution to that regional conflict, which has gone on for far too long. My Government therefore strongly encourages dialogue between our two brotherly countries, Morocco and Algeria, and welcomes all initiatives likely to contribute to ensuring peace in that region, in particular the relaunch of the political process, based on Security Council resolutions.
In the same vein, with respect to the sovereignty of States, the Union of the Comoros reiterates its position on the need for the People’s Republic of China to recover its integrity with respect to the Chinese province of Taiwan. In that context and given the threats that weigh on world peace today, which everyone recognizes and understands, my Government invites all parties involved in the various conflicts to show restraint and a spirit of responsibility.
With regard to the highly worrisome situation in the Sahel, we know from experience how dangerous it is to allow hotbeds of tension to arise and become fertile ground for the expansion of international terrorism. My Government is all the more attentive to this issue as we have seen the rise in power in southern Africa of the barbaric Al-Shabaab phenomenon, which constitutes
a threat on land and at sea for the entire continent. I reaffirm, as I did last year before the Assembly (see A/76/PV.10), that these groups threatening peace in the world are not Muslims. They are quite simply terrorists who have nothing to do with Islam, which is a religion of peace, tolerance and coexistence.
However, we are aware that behind these contemporary terrorist phenomena, which we must fight vigorously, there is also a great deal of frustration among young people who have no points of reference and are in search of a future. In that regard, I appeal to the great Powers of this world and recall that while their support is an essential contribution to the economic and social development of the States under the greatest threat, said support should be designed in such a way as to also meet the aspirations of the peoples that benefit from it. I am convinced that nothing beats prevention when it comes to building peace, security and stability in the world. The only way is to manage the complex issues that threaten world peace at their earliest stages, through dialogue and diplomacy.
I cannot talk about conflicts without mentioning the territorial dispute between my country and France concerning the Comorian island of Mayotte. My Government, like all those that have preceded it, solemnly recalls before the Assembly, and in accordance with international law, Comorian sovereignty over this island, which was removed from Comorian rule during the decolonization process of our country. The management of this painful dossier, which has lasted for more than 40 years, is very fortunately seeing new perspectives open up with the spirit of dialogue that has been created between the Comorian and French parties.
The principles and values of the United Nations are now gathered around the Sustainable Development Goals, which each country has made a priority. It should be recalled that climate change is one of the important elements of the Sustainable Development Goals. However, entire regions are simply destined to disappear, while others are daily subject to the intensification of climate phenomena, such as floods, intense droughts, fires, coastal erosion or the acidification of the oceans. While these disasters spare no country or region, it should be emphasized that the case of island developing States like the Comoros is even more worrisome and deserves greater attention from us leaders. I also take this opportunity to renew our condolences, support and sympathy to the authorities and the people of Pakistan, and through them, to the bereaved families and the victims of the heavy floods that have affected this brotherly country.
Our States are also confronting other dangerous phenomena, such as piracy, pollution, illegal fishing, the plunder of resources at sea, human trafficking and drug trafficking, which require our utmost attention. My Government joins all regional and global initiatives in waging a merciless fight against these barbaric acts, which are one of the major threats to the security of property and people. That is why I have always attached great importance to the security dimension in our geostrategic action, particularly in the Mozambique Channel area and the south-west Indian Ocean region.
My country, the Union of the Comoros, has just celebrated 47 years of independence. Although the first two decades following that regained freedom were marred by political unrest, turmoil and instability, the country has enjoyed peace and stability for more than 20 years now. It is therefore necessary to do everything possible to consolidate and perpetuate this newfound political stability because it constitutes a real guarantee of socioeconomic development. Our salvation lies, in fact, in a peaceful, united society that is increasingly inclusive of all the structures that make it up.
Thus, with a view to better national cohesion and mid-mandate, last February we held a national political dialogue aimed at bringing together more Comorian men and women around essential objectives, including peace, security and national unity, with a view to sustainable socioeconomic development. The Assembly will understand why I wish to thank all the partners who were kind enough to lend their support to that dialogue. I remain convinced that all the vital forces of the nation that took part in that important meeting will work towards the consolidation of the achievements of the past 20 years, in terms of human rights and the democratic transfer of power, and thereby advance the development of the country.
With regard to human rights, allow me to emphasize that my country works closely with the relevant regional and international bodies and has successfully passed the four-year universal periodic review mechanism of the Human Rights Council in 2019. The constitutional and legislative reforms carried out confirm my country’s desire to make human rights a national priority.
With respect to social outcomes and all other areas, COVID-19 has been a concern and forced countries to prioritize its management. The Union of the Comoros experienced two waves, the second of which proved to be more virulent, claiming many victims. Nevertheless, the situation in the country has been brought under control thanks to forethought and the provisions taken by the authorities in that respect, and with the support of our bilateral and multilateral partners, the communities and civil society. We thank them once again. It must be said that even if the Union of the Comoros is, thankfully, currently classified in the “green” category, we must remain vigilant, especially being an island country, in order to avoid a new outbreak of the disease. Consequently, the Comorian Government is making considerable efforts to support the population on a daily basis, particularly in this time of global food crisis resulting from COVID-19 and aggravated by the Russian-Ukrainian crisis.
I welcome the action of all the development partners of the Comoros and reiterate my thanks to them here. Alongside the United Nations system, the newly signed framework plan for sustainable development for the next five years perfectly integrates the priorities held by the Emerging Comoros Plan, the reference framework par excellence for the development of our country. The combined efforts of the Government and bilateral and multilateral partners must converge towards a major objective, that of the emergence of our country by 2030. In that light, in early December we intend to organize in the country a follow-up seminar to the Conference of Development Partners that was held in France in 2019 in order to mobilize the promises made to support this challenge of emergence by 2030. I would like therefore to launch from this rostrum a friendly and fraternal appeal to all our partners to find together the ways and means of evolving towards the concretization of the commitments we made in Paris to finance the various projects targeted in the programme.
At the regional level, I attach particular importance to the close cooperation that exists between the Comoros and the countries with which we share a common destiny in the Indian Ocean area. The Union of the Comoros also participates in regional efforts aimed at ensuring security in eastern Africa and, in that context, supports the sisterly Republic of Mozambique in its fight against terrorism, a scourge that spares no country. Regional and international solidarity must therefore prevail if we are to wage a merciless fight against this scourge and ensure the safety of all.
Our presence every year here at the United Nations is irrefutable proof of the interest we place in multilateralism and of our conviction of the major role of the Organization in further humanizing the world. This year, it reflects an even stronger and unshakable common resolve to act for the good of our respective peoples.
In conclusion, I would like to stress the need for continued unity and solidarity within the international community. It is together and within an organized framework that we will find the appropriate solutions to the great challenges of our time, for greater peace and progress, and for the betterment of all of us and generations to come.

Congo - Brazzaville,COG,Africa,"  5,244,000 ",4310,10.94699955,5.5,64.29,Cardiovascular Disease,HIV/AIDS,Neoplasm,349,6.66,"  2,596,677 ",49.52,5.29,"The universal premise of multilateralism, enshrined in our Organization since its very creation, has never been so seriously undermined as it is today, before our very eyes.
We are witnessing an unprecedented intensification of crises throughout the world. We are witnessing the proliferation of conflicts and an increase in their complexity. We are witnessing unprecedented food insecurity and dangerous threats to biodiversity. We are even witnessing attempts to call into question the commitments made collectively and ratified here, in this very Hall, on environmental protection and the preservation of the planet, our shared home.
As though that were not enough, we are witnessing an exacerbation of dissent and enmity between the permanent members of the Security Council, whose main task is to maintain international peace and security by working together.
Faced with such a situation, whereby our common fragilities are aggravated and our collective vulnerabilities highlighted, only a consensus-based, supportive, calm and coordinated approach can help us to find the true answers to those problems. I believe that the theme under which our general debate is being held provides us with a real opportunity to do just that. Indeed, by calling for transformative solutions, this year’s theme appeals to our collective conscience with regard to the increasing number of challenges that besiege us on a daily basis and that can sometimes take a dramatic turn.
Indeed, one has only to think of the current war in Ukraine and the apocalyptic projections — which are not baseless — that strategists and other military experts are now making about a possible tragic downturn in those terrible events.
Given the enormous risk of nuclear disaster that such events pose to the entire planet, it is the responsibility not just of the conflict’s participants, but also the foreign Powers that can influence the course of events towards peace, if they seek to temper their passions, stop fanning the flames and turn their backs on the vanity of the powerful that has hitherto kept the door to dialogue closed.
Under the auspices of the United Nations, we must all commit ourselves, without delay, to peace negotiations that are just, sincere and equitable. Ever since the Congress of Vienna, after the battle of Waterloo, it has been clear that wars must always end around the negotiating table. The world urgently needs negotiations to prevent the current conflicts, which are already so devastating, from reaching a crescendo and tipping humankind into what could be a cataclysm without remedy, namely, a generalized nuclear war beyond the control of the great Powers themselves. Albert Einstein, the great theoretician of the atom, said gravely that such a war, if it were to take place, would be the last battle to ever be fought on Earth.
Nelson Mandela, a man of eternal forgiveness, said that peace is a long road, but it has no alternative. It has no price. Indeed, Russians and Ukrainians have no other choice but to take that path — the path of peace. Moreover, we should accompany them, throughout the world, in great numbers, working together in solidarity, tenaciously and fully capable of imposing unconditional peace on the war lobby.
I want to be direct and address my dear Russian and Ukrainian friends, in particular. Too much blood has been spilled — the sacred blood of their sweet children. It is time to stop this mass destruction. It is time to stop the war. The entire world is watching. The time has come to fight for life, just as they courageously and selflessly fought together against the Nazis during the Second World War, in particular in Leningrad, Stalingrad, Kursk and Berlin. It is important to consider the young people of both countries and the fate of future generations. It is time to fight for peace. It is time to fight for them. It is important to give peace a real chance now, before it is too late for us all. I humbly ask that of them.
What I just said, in my basic Russian, about the events in Ukraine can allow us to draw a parallel, although perhaps at a completely different level, with the tragic situation Libya has been facing since 2011. It is a situation to which, for many years, the President of the Republic of the Congo, Denis Sassou Nguesso, has been fully committed to resolving on behalf of the African Union. He continued his peace efforts on the controversial issue on 14 and 15 July in Brazzaville, during consultations that brought together several stakeholders who represent the core of Libyan social and political views. The objective was to encourage the stakeholders to talk to each other and bridge the gaps between their views on the challenges their country has faced since the failed elections of 24 December 2021.
The inter-Libyan reconciliation conference, which is the goal of the African mediation efforts, will make sense only if it is inclusive, constructive and consensus- based. It must enable our Libyan brothers and sisters to stop eyeing each other with mistrust, forgive each other, resume dialogue and prioritize justice, which is the foundation of a new Libya, from which they are to rewrite history. I would like to commend the appointment of Mr. Abdoulaye Bathily as the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Libya. I can already assure him of the unconditional support of President Denis Sassou Nguesso, who chairs the African Union Ad Hoc High-level Committee on Libya.
The forests of the Congo basin are the second largest environmental reservoir on the planet, and we have preserved those forests for years, as they are dear to our hearts. We still await strong support that is commensurate with the existential challenges that those forests represent.
We should always remember the promises that were made, from Copenhagen to Glasgow and under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Those promises were made with enthusiasm but, to date, they remain unfulfilled by the rich countries — the same countries responsible for 80 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. However, in spite of that, as we prepare for the twenty- seventh session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which Africa will host next November, we hope that this time, at least, instead of the statements of commiseration to which we are accustomed and the usual formulas and hollow promises, considerable resources will finally be mobilized for poor countries that have become even more vulnerable owing to climate disruptions.
In any event, with the lowest deforestation rate in the world — only 0.06 per cent — my country, the Republic of the Congo, is playing its full role and will continue to do so to protect the environment and ensure the survival of humankind. The establishment of the Blue Fund for the Congo Basin is part of the regional plan for that commitment. Together with the Government of the United Kingdom, the host of COP 26, my country’s Government plans to launch, over the next few weeks, a political forum entitled “Forests and climate leaders’ partnership”.
I cannot conclude my statement and leave this rostrum without mentioning two situations, which should unceasingly appeal to our conscience. Morally, we cannot give up on those two situations.
The first concerns Security Council reform, which has become a hackneyed topic. It is a reform that everyone glosses over at will and the outcome of which seems to every day draw farther away from its noble goals, although the need for Africa’s inclusion in the management of world affairs is self-evident. Africa must indeed assume its rightful role in the community of nations. To believe otherwise is simply a show of selfishness, and goes against the current of history. Similarly, continuing to prevaricate over the idea of admitting two African countries as full permanent members of the Security Council is nothing more than willingly choosing to discredit our prestigious Organization. We, the representatives of allied countries meeting here at the United Nations, must make the honourable choice, here and now, and go down in history by ridding ourselves, once and for all, of the medieval and obscure prejudices against Africa, which, for too long, have humiliated that part of the world.
The second situation concerns the never-ending embargo on Cuba, which has been in place since the middle of the last century and continues to cause indescribable suffering to the people of that country. The embargo, which is totally anachronistic and obsolete, should have been abolished long ago. On behalf of my country, I again call on the wisdom of the American people and its leaders, who, as we know, for the most part, have nothing to do with that outdated embodiment of the Cold War.
On that subject, and I wish to conclude here, I would very respectfully like to address President Biden, who has long promoted the ideal of peace, as he did in this very Hall last week (see A/77.PV.6). I urge him to be bold and to close, without further delay, the dark chapter of relations with Cuba, which belongs in the past. By doing so, he will undeniably create new possibilities in the glorious history of his beautiful country, and I am convinced that posterity will thank him."
Costa Rica,CRI,North America,"  4,999,000 ",13986,8.140000343,7.1,80.095,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Digestive Disease,407,8.14,"  4,994,001 ",99.90,8.99,"Costa Rica congratulates the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session on his election. We are confident that his extensive political experience will be crucial to the success of the work ahead.
A maelstrom of challenges is shaking the foundations of our Organization. The pandemic has been raging for three years now, and 30.3 per cent of humankind have yet to receive a single vaccine. The climate crisis and biodiversity loss are hitting us mercilessly and without discrimination. We are currently experiencing that at first hand in Pakistan, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica. Yet as the most vulnerable countries we are the ones stepping up our efforts, creating large protection and conservation areas and increasing our adaptation and mitigation efforts, while the biggest carbon emitters and those responsible for the climate catastrophe continue to ignore their obligations.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine not only violated the principles of the Charter of the United Nations but also provoked a humanitarian, fuel and financial crisis that will drive millions of people into food insecurity and poverty.
Moreover, the invasion has also threatened our collective security system and provoked renewed division and polarization into geopolitical and economic blocs that pit East against West and North against South. All that is happening at the very moment when we needed to build more bridges and fewer walls, when we should not lose sight of the situations in Yemen and Mali, in Myanmar and Syria, in Libya and Haiti, in Tigray and the Sahel and between Israel and Palestine.
The attacks on democracy and human rights, especially those of women and girls, also know no borders. The decline of democracy is evident in Central Asia, Eastern Europe, the Asia-Pacific and my own region, where the situation in Nicaragua demands the urgent attention of the international community to ensure the release of hundreds of political prisoners, the restoration of freedom of expression and the press, civil
society’s right of association and a return to democracy. In terms of rights, the cruellest example can be found in Afghanistan, where for the past year girls above the sixth grade have been forbidden to go to school, leaving them even more exposed to violence, poverty and exploitation. We have come to the General Assembly to identify comprehensive solutions to the multiple crises we face, because it is impossible to end poverty without empowering women and girls, ensure respect for human rights without addressing climate change, and address the reform of the international financial system without new parameters for the allocation of assistance.
First, for Costa Rica, the response to the multiple crises we face must be based on a rights and obligations approach. Human rights and unequivocal respect for human dignity and value are not just words. They are obligations undertaken by States, enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and all our human rights treaties and instruments. They are also the expression of the legitimate and universal aspirations of every person, of all peoples, who after all are the ones who enable us to be in this solemn Hall and to speak on their behalf. Costa Rica too faces challenges and gaps with regard to the full enjoyment of human rights, the building of a culture of peace and non-discrimination and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. We are aware that human rights are essential to combating poverty, inequality and exclusion. They are not a stumbling block, and nor should they be. They are nothing less than the only way forward.
Costa Rica has never closed its doors to migrants who see in our country a route of passage or a destination to integrate into our society. In 2021, we were fourth in the world in terms of receiving new refugee applications per capita. And we welcome the largest number of Nicaraguan citizens of any country in the world. However, our economic situation and tight finances, together with massive migratory flows, limit our ability to take action and jeopardize the shelter that we always provided to the hundreds of thousands of people who have sought refuge on our soil in the past. It is with a real sense of urgency that we call on the support of the international community to address that challenge, which has been aggravated not only by conflict and poverty but also by the impact of climate change.
In a context of multiple and accumulated crises, human rights must forge new paths. Costa Rica welcomed the General Assembly’s recognition on 28 July of the universal right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment (resolution 76/300). For my country that is a beacon of hope comparable to the proclamation of the right to water, to development or to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and it is the right response to our triple planetary crisis of pollution, climate change and the loss of biodiversity. The resolution is a point of departure rather than of arrival. Costa Rica will continue to work with Member States, the United Nations and all stakeholders to break down the silo mentality and provide effective solutions to human problems, especially for those who suffer the most — the most vulnerable, marginalized and excluded.
True to our commitment to the rights agenda, Costa Rica has decided to submit its candidacy for election to the Human Rights Council for the period from 2023 to 2025. Costa Rica respectfully requests the support of the members of the General Assembly for its candidacy. Our country is an ambitious actor willing to watch over the rights of all people everywhere in the world, as well as a country that will readily commit to dialogue, mutual understanding, cooperation and solidarity in support of humankind.
Secondly, human security is key to global security. We find it inconceivable that while millions of people are waiting for life-saving vaccines, medicines or food, the richest countries continue to prioritize spending on arms at the expense of people’s welfare, climate health and equitable recovery. In 2021, global military spending continued to increase for the seventh consecutive year to reach the highest figure ever recorded in history. Today Costa Rica reiterates its call for a gradual and sustained reduction in military spending, because the more weapons we produce, the more weapons will escape even our best efforts to manage and control them. It is about prioritizing the lives and well-being of people and the planet over the profits to be made from weapons and war. It is about investing in and actively building alternative approaches to security, approaches that facilitate cooperation and care rather than competition and violence.
We also believe that it is possible to achieve peace and security without resorting to the use of nuclear weapons. Since the total elimination of nuclear weapons is the only guarantee against their use or threat of use, Costa Rica urges more States to sign and ratify the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, as
well as to adhere to the Vienna Declaration on Nuclear Safety and its action plan.
We also urge the Russian Federation to cease its attacks on Ukraine and its civilians and critical infrastructure, to demilitarize the Zaporizhzhya plant and not to resort to nuclear coercion, which we condemn in the strongest terms. Costa Rica calls on both parties to ensure respect, at all times and in all circumstances, for international human rights law and international humanitarian law.
The third transformative solution must be financial. We middle-income countries face significant inequalities and challenges, such as increased fiscal tightening, which limit our capacity for action and investment and threaten our social fabric. And even though we are home to the highest percentage of poor people and migrants in the world, our categorization does not allow us to access official development assistance or obtain concessional financing on favourable and fair terms. It is therefore vital to go beyond measurements such as gross domestic product per capita with new parameters for the allocation of aid, investment and international cooperation that take into account other aspects, such as structural deficiencies, climate risks, market fluctuations and fiscal stability.
The fourth action requires a higher level of ambition and urgency to address the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. Safeguarding marine resources and the health of the ocean is critical to this end.
In the front line against the natural disasters that hit our countries, droughts and heat waves, forest fires and unprecedented floods are people. With them in mind, Costa Rica, together with France and the United Kingdom, is leading the High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People, which seeks global conservation of 30 per cent of the Earth and 30 per cent of the ocean by 2030.
Costa Rica, which has achieved the conservation of 30 per cent of the waters under its national jurisdiction nine years ahead of schedule, invites other States to meet this shared goal. In addition, together with French President Emmanuel Macron, we announced our interest in co-hosting, in 2025, the third United Nations Ocean Conference and in holding a meeting in mid-2024 in Costa Rica that will bring together the scientific community and civil society to formulate innovative solutions for improving ocean governance.
The ocean is an immeasurable and critical resource for the continuity of life on Earth. Therefore, on this International Day of Peace, Costa Rica fervently calls for the adoption of a declaration of peace for the ocean. We cannot survive as a species without our ocean. We will not be able to fulfil our various obligations vis-a-vis the Sustainable Development Goals without a healthy ocean.
Let us support the Secretary-General’s initiative for a New Agenda for Peace, which strengthens our collective capacity to prevent conflicts and resolve existing ones with sustainable, locally driven solutions.
Let us renew the social contract between our Governments and our peoples, anchoring governance arrangements in human rights, trust, inclusion, protection and participation.
Let us ensure gender parity and empower women — and in particular girls — in all spheres of life.
Let us seek new methods to measure development that adequately reflect such essential aspects as environmental sustainability, inequalities and structural gaps, the quality of institutions and the prevalence of the rule of law.
Let us build a more resilient, transparent and inclusive multilateral system and a United Nations that better embraces the needs and perspectives of all, especially within the Security Council.
Let us do more to pave the way for the United Nations to fully rise to the occasion, to do all that it has the capacity and determination to do, to help it and our own countries change the course of our common destiny while there is still a destiny to change.
Let us act with conviction and courage, with determination and with a real sense of urgency. The time is now."
Cote d'Ivoire,CIV,Africa,"  25,069,000 ",3664,2.599999905,5.3,57.422,Cardiovascular Disease,Neonatal Disorder,HIV/AIDS,2288,9.13,"  17,467,859 ",69.68,4.81,"At the outset, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your well-deserved election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session. I wish you every success in fulfilling this great responsibility.
I would also like to sincerely congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Abdulla Shahid, on his outstanding leadership and effective management of our work during the past session. During a challenging time, characterized in particular by the coronavirus disease pandemic, his commendable initiatives enabled us to maintain hope for a better future.
I would like to pay heartfelt tribute to Secretary- General Antonio Guterres and assure him of my country’s full support for his tireless efforts to strengthen the role of the Organization in achieving
the goals we have set ourselves. We encourage the Secretary-General in every regard, including in the implementation of the relevant provisions contained in his report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982).
Cote d’Ivoire welcomes the major successes that the United Nations has achieved in many areas since its founding. In that context, my country would like to thank the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which declared the cessation of refugee status for Ivorian refugees on 30 June. I take this opportunity to commend the excellent cooperation between UNHCR and my country. Nevertheless, the multiple and complex challenges involving peace, security, democracy, the protection of human rights and the preservation of the environment remain matters of concern. I welcome the relevance of the theme of this session, which calls on us to consider solutions to overcome the challenges before us.
The exacerbation of geopolitical tensions and the emergence of new international conflicts are endangering international peace and security. The recent war in Ukraine has reminded us that peace is a perennial quest that we must pursue relentlessly. The confrontation, which poses the threat of the use of nuclear weapons, continues to undermine world peace and plunge humankind into multiple crises. It demonstrates to us once again the shortcomings of resorting to the military option in the resolution of conflicts. That is why Cote d’Ivoire, which has always advocated for peaceful coexistence and the use of dialogue in the search for solutions to disputes among nations, renews its call for the immediate and definitive cessation of hostilities in Ukraine.
The war has serious economic, financial and social consequences for African countries. Indeed, the rise in the price of oil and difficulties in supplying markets with cereals and fertilizers have led to widespread inflation, an increase in interest rates in international markets and a slowdown in world growth. For several African countries, the conflict has therefore resulted in difficulties in financing their economies, an increase in the price of basic commodities and even famine-like conditions, owing to their dependence on grain and fertilizer from Ukraine and Russia.
That situation has led the Ivorian Government to subsidize the cost of petroleum products and wheat and temporarily cap the price of several staple foods in order to support households, particularly those in greatest need. I welcome the signing of the agreement in Istanbul on 22 July on the export of wheat from Ukraine, brokered by the United Nations and Tiirkiye.
However, we regret that only 17 per cent of the wheat exported from Ukraine since that date has been earmarked for African countries. Therefore, Cote d’Ivoire asks once again that priority be given to Africa in the implementation of the Istanbul agreement. We also call on the international financial institutions and Africa’s development partners to urgently raise the necessary resources to support the most vulnerable countries so that they can deal with the multiple effects of the conflict in Ukraine.
United Nations peacekeeping operations are the tangible results of our collective efforts in the service of peace in countries affected by conflict. Cote d’Ivoire, which hosted one of the largest United Nations peacekeeping operations in Africa, fully appreciates the sacrifices made by troop-contributing countries to enable the restoration of peace and facilitate postconflict reconstruction.
Based on the success of the United Nations Operation in Cote d’Ivoire and our faith in the values of the Charter of the United Nations, we have actively participated in United Nations peacekeeping operations, as I stated before the Security Council in December 2018 (see S/PV.8413). In that regard, I am pleased that Cote d’Ivoire participates in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) and the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic. I commend the professionalism of the Ivorian contingents deployed in those peacekeeping operations.
I pay tribute to the memory of the Ivorian soldiers who died in the service of peace in the brotherly country of Mali, which requires the resolute commitment of all those at its side in its fight against armed terrorist groups. Unfortunately, in the context of the fight against terrorism, 46 Ivorian soldiers, who are part of the eighth rotation of the national support element within MINUSMA, have been unjustly detained there since 10 July. I once again call for their immediate release. My country encourages the Malian authorities to focus their efforts on combating terrorism and resolutely implementing the various stages of the transition timetable and the political and institutional reforms, in view of the presidential elections scheduled
for February 2024, for the sake of the welfare of the Malian people.
Terrorism continues to pose a major threat to international peace and security and to represent an immense challenge that no country has succeeded in overcoming alone. We therefore must strengthen our pooled resources to combat that scourge and demonstrate solidarity and determination.
In that regard, my country commends the decisive action taken by France and its European partners in the Sahel and reiterates its call for the greater involvement of the other major Powers in the fight against terrorism in the Sahel and the Gulf of Guinea by supporting national armies, the Economic Community of West African States and the Accra initiative. In order to contribute to that collective effort, Cote d’Ivoire has opened to African countries the International Counter- Terrorism Academy, which is based in the coastal town of Jacqueville and provides training in all civilian and military sectors involved in the fight against terrorism.
The current session of the General Assembly is being held at a time when the energy crisis resulting from the war in Ukraine has tended to compromise the progress made in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, particularly as a consequence of some industrialized countries’ return to the use of coal. Unfortunately, time is running out, and we must act quickly and implement all of the commitments under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change to meet the goal of maintaining global warming below 1.5°C. In order to meet that goal, developed countries must drastically reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions and uphold their commitment to contributing $100 billion dollars a year to developing countries.
I am convinced that the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Egypt, will provide a new opportunity to renew the political commitment of all stakeholders to contribute to financing the fight against global warming. I would like to point out once again that my country will uphold its commitments under the Paris Agreement and is committed to protecting its forest heritage and rich biodiversity.
That is the raison d’etre of the Abidj an initiative—the Abidjan Legacy Programme — launched at the fifteenth session of the Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, which Cote d’Ivoire had the honour to host from 9 to 20 May. I was delighted by the exceptional commitment and financial support of development partners for the Abidjan initiative, which very quickly garnered the resources necessary for its implementation, in the amount of more than $2.5 billion.
Today more than ever, humankind is at a turning point with regard to its future. The threats facing our countries compel us to show greater solidarity, collaboration, justice and equity — the principles that underpin the multilateralism to which my country remains committed. In the same spirit, Cote d’Ivoire calls for a thorough reform of the Security Council, in which Africa will be able take its rightful place."
Croatia,HRV,Europe,"  4,156,000 ",21625,11.21000004,5.5,78.342,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,676,16.27,"  4,156,000 ",100.00,10.45,"We have gathered this year as a brutal war with a multifaceted and global impact continues to rage in Europe. The Russian aggression against Ukraine has upended the rules-based order, the multilateral system and economic flows. It has brought about human suffering and refugee flows, destruction of civilian infrastructure and war crimes. The latest announcements about partial mobilization in Russia, preparations for the organization of sham referendums in occupied parts of Ukraine and nuclear threats are another dangerous escalation in an already unprecedented crisis. While the Ukrainian people are suffering the most in their struggle to defend their homes, the consequences of the Russian aggression are felt globally and so it must be condemned worldwide.
Three decades ago, Croatia itself was a war-ravaged country in jeopardy, also facing armed aggression. Almost a third of its territory was occupied. Additionally, we had to fight for international recognition and were under an arms embargo. The Croatian people know what it means to be under attack and what it takes to defend their homeland. Against all odds, Croatia and the Croatian people prevailed. Many, especially our defenders, paid the highest price for our freedom and liberty. Stronger for its own experience, Croatia today is an exporter of peace and stability, a humanitarian donor worldwide, a popular tourist destination and the country that produces the fastest electric car in the world.
Success is possible if one is determined and has a vision of the future. Precisely because of our own experience, Croatia immediately and unequivocally extended political, humanitarian, economic and military support and solidarity to Ukraine. To do otherwise would be a betrayal of principles and values we all hold dear, particularly respect for human rights and responsibility to protect populations from atrocity crimes. This time around, Europe and its partners came together to stand up to aggression, show solidarity and strengthen their own resilience. In October, we will highlight this unity once more in Zagreb, as Croatia prepares to host the first-ever Parliamentary Summit of the Crimea Platform.
Croatia’s transition was long and complex, but it was guided by a firm notion that democracy, human rights and respect for national minorities was the best way for Croatian society as a whole to further develop and prosper. Today our democratic systems are challenged by the fallacious and dangerous thesis that autocracy is ultimately a more efficient and pragmatic way to govern. Our national dialogues are distorted by targeted disinformation, fake news and hybrid attacks. Our trust in democracy is being undermined from both within and outside of our societies.
As fierce as these challenges are, our commitment to democracy, its procedures and values must remain strong. On the crossroads between democracy and autocracy, our choice should remain clear. In today’s perilous moment, Croatia remains a staunch supporter of the international rules-based order and the United Nations at the centre of global cooperation. Although far from being ideal, this system, with all of its flaws, has still enabled the world to reach common ground and find some remarkable and inspirational results for local and global issues in the almost eight decades of its existence.
We live in a plurality of simultaneous and interconnected crises that affect us all. In order to overcome this perfect storm of crises, we need determined action now. The further erosion of our core rules and values should be halted and reversed, respect for international law upheld and accountability ensured. We should also act to make our system fit for purpose. That is particularly true for the reform of the Security Council. The General Assembly intervened instead and offered a platform for an overwhelming majority of States to condemn the aggression against a sovereign and independent country.
When the world is facing a geopolitical crisis of the scale such as the one in Ukraine today, we must ensure that our policies and actions are predictable, reliable and timely across the United Nations system. Croatia’s adherence to promoting peace and security is evident also in its continuous participation in the United Nations, European Union (EU) and NATO peacekeeping missions and operations. It is an investment we are readily willing to make.
As we were beginning to recover from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the war in Ukraine dramatically altered our perspectives and political agenda. It radically changed not only the security
but also the energy architecture of Europe, and is threatening global food security. We must stand united and step up our efforts to reorganize the energy supply lines. We cannot accept extortion and we cannot be held hostage over food and energy, which all of us need. Therefore, we applaud the Secretary-General and the United Nations for their role in brokering the deal to export Ukrainian grain.
On the regional level, Croatia is contributing to energy security and diversification by its liquefied natural gas terminal on the Adriatic island of Krk. Beyond ensuring its own needs, Croatia is now able to supply its neighbours and other countries in Central Europe. Simultaneously, we are investing in renewable energy, with a third of our energy consumption and almost half of our electricity production already coming from renewables. We are ensuring a fair transition and preventing energy poverty, implementing financial measures that benefit both the citizens and the business sector.
We must find a global solution to the price of gas, which threatens our households and our economies. It is intolerable for a minority of speculators to enrich themselves in these times by imposing exorbitant prices. What is more, we are also witnessing an intolerable imbalance in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. The richest 1 per cent in the world are responsible for 15 per cent of emissions — twice as much as half the poorest of humankind. That is not acceptable. It is up to those who pollute the most to provide the most effort; that is not only fair but also the most effective if we are to achieve our climate objectives.
Clean mobility and innovative technologies are an opportunity and new technologies, such as hydrogen, offer new horizons for stronger cooperation between Europe, Africa and the Middle East. While we in Croatia successfully passed the test during the pandemic and avoided social fracture with tailored national measures, global inflation and the rise of prices have to be tackled again. We as a Government are continuing our interventionist policy to alleviate the burden of the energy crisis on our households and businesses, local Governments and public institutions, schools and hospitals. Similar to our efforts during the pandemic, we are now implementing a strong national package worth more than 6 per cent of our gross domestic product. That includes financial measures, subsidies for vulnerable groups and limitations on the prices of basic food items.
I wish to say a few words on climate change and biodiversity. Despite the enormous current challenges, we have a responsibility to also safeguard our commitments to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Croatia welcomes the ambitious approach put forward in the report of the Secretary-General Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) as a concrete road map towards its realization. Here, too, a revitalized global action and political commitment are needed to ensure effective multilateralism. By integrating the Sustainable Development Goals in its national development strategy towards 2030, Croatia has proven its dedication to their full implementation.
As a current member of the Economic and Social Council, we will work closely together with our partners to ensure more sustainable, greener, inclusive and equitable societies in which no one will be left behind. Ahead of the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Egypt, let us evaluate the implementation of our joint commitments from Glasgow. We need to strengthen cooperation in the effort to find mechanisms and financial resources to fulfil the Paris Agreement and to continue the fight against climate change at the national, regional and global levels.
In the year in which we are marking the thirtieth anniversary of our United Nations membership, Croatia remains a constructive and responsible international actor. In the coming months, we will join a group of only 15 other countries that are at the same time members of the EU, NATO, the Eurozone and the Schengen Area. That follows a sober and prudent decision in line with my Government’s policy of modern sovereignism. Through that policy, we have strengthened our international position by pooling resources with our allies and partners, furthering our national interests and tackling economic and social challenges.
Croatia also pays special attention to South-East Europe, a region still not fully integrated into the EU. The region’s stability, development and democratic progress are not only in our, but also in Europe’s interest. We support a clear European Union perspective for candidates and aspirants based on the fulfilment of well-established and clear criteria, the implementation of reforms and the delivery of tangible results. The stability of neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina, with which we share a 1,000-kilometre border, is of particular importance to Croatia. We would like to see
a prosperous and functional Bosnia and Herzegovina progressing firmly on the path to EU membership.
In the light of the current situation in Ukraine and elsewhere, it is pivotal that international law and international treaties be respected. That includes in particular peace treaties such as the Dayton-Paris Peace Agreement, which brought peace to Bosnia and Herzegovina as the multinational and multicultural homeland of its three constitutive peoples — Croats, Bosniaks and Serbs — as well as others. For the cohesion, stability and progress of the country, their constitutional full equality must be ensured and respected. Given the fact that the Bosniak political leaders have publicly admitted they had no true intention of coming to a deal with Bosnian Croat political leaders over the electoral reform, in line with the Constitutional Court verdict, the only way forward remains for High Representative Christian Schmidt to act and use his Bonn powers. As a friend of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I call upon him to use his powers to ensure legitimate representation and equality of Bosnian Croats in the country’s institutions following the 2 October general election. As the least numerous among the constituent peoples, the Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina demand no favours, only equality.
We are mutually interdependent. Turmoil in one region has consequences for us, all no matter where we are on the globe. None of our national goals can be achieved without solidarity and the rules-based order upon which not only our security, but also our survival rests. We must build, protect and defend, and stand up to those who destroy, lie and loot. As we witness aggression and atrocities on European soil again and as the rule of power threatens to bring the world order down, we owe it to future generations to be on the right side of history.
The international community must foster its unity and stand with Ukraine in the fight for its own existence. We have to unite in our respect for international law, as well as in finding global solutions to overlapping crises, including rising inflation, energy and food crises. To achieve secure and affordable energy, we need a global solution for gas prices. We must also ensure sustainable energy transition.
Our world has changed permanently. In these new circumstances, more international cooperation has no alternative. Let us commit to working jointly for the benefit of our common future. The approach of democracies in international relations is a cooperative one. The approach of the authoritarian regimes is a conflictual one. The global Organization, the United Nations — and all of us within it — must prove that the rules-based order and the cooperative approach will prevail."
Cyprus,CYP,Europe,"  1,189,000 ",26540,11.03999996,6.3,80.828,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,44,3.70,"  1,189,000 ",100.00,10.92,"With only a few months left of my 10-year tenure in office, I stand before members to address the plenary session of the General Assembly for the very last time. I would have wished nothing more than for this address to have been a reflection of positive developments in what humankind has had to face or is facing. Like all of those here, I would have liked to have applauded the results of the implementation either of the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations or of the decisions and resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council.
That would have ensured that any threat or attempt to call into question the sovereignty and territorial integrity of any United Nations State Member would have been brought to a complete halt or minimized; that long-standing conflicts and disputes would have been resolved or would be in the process of being resolved in accordance with the decisions and resolutions of the United Nations; that the need for the Organization’s reform would have led to the effective prevention of new threats and challenges to world peace; that, through its new role, the United Nations would have implemented projects to effectively combat hunger and to improve the living conditions of hundreds of millions of people in dire need of aid; and that the number of refugees and migrants forced to flee from their homes due to conflict or poverty would have been greatly reduced.
Furthermore, that would have ensured that we would have been able to tackle social and economic exclusion, the lack of adequate health-care standards and the shortage of educational opportunities; that
sustainable development would have finally become a reality for all countries and regions in need by establishing the necessary political and socioeconomic conditions that lead to stability, economic growth and institution-building; that measures for the prevention of climate change and its devastating consequences would have been implemented consistently by all parties involved; that terrorism and religious fundamentalism would have given way to tolerance and understanding; that the trillions of dollars spent on destructive weapons would instead have been spent on actions and programmes aiming to bridge the gap between rich and poor States; and, finally, that multilateralism would have been the guiding doctrine of all States.
In addressing the General Assembly in 2018 and referring to the weakness of dealing with the same problems, I wondered aloud:
“how is it that we come back again and again, year after year, as a kind of ritual, to attest to the dismal lack of effectiveness for some and the attempts at embellishment of others for what is in fact our inability to fulfil the aims of the Charter of the United Nations?” (A/73/PV.10, p. 5)
I wondered further:
“Why do the decisions of the Security Council in their overwhelming majority remain mere certificates that attest to violations? Why are international law and international agreements not implemented? Why do strategies and programmes aimed at creating better conditions for people who are suffering remain wishful thinking?”
Although I am well aware that what I am about to say is well known to everyone in attendance, for the sake of history I cannot but relay some truths that are leading us on a declining path and to the gradual loss of credibility of the United Nations, an Organization that was formed right after the Second World War in order to prevent new disasters and to provide protection and hope to those in need of effective protection, as well as to take action to tackle the challenges I just mentioned.
I know that what I am saying may be outside the bounds of diplomatic etiquette, but I believe that the obligation of each leader before history is not to overlook failings and shortcomings in favour of wishful thinking or flattery. That is why I will proceed with a review, not just of the reasons that have transformed the Organization into a repository of problems, but also of what States are required to do in order to lend credibility to the Organization so that it can effectively impose international legal order and consistently implement decisions and programmes for the benefit of humankind.
In my opinion, the weaknesses and inefficacies of the United Nations are due to several factors.
The first problem is the fact that international law is dictated by the financial or other interests of powerful Member States.
Secondly, despite the end of the Cold War, alliances based on common interests lead to tolerance towards States that violate international law if the offender is under their sphere of influence.
Thirdly, there is a resurgence of hegemonic tendencies by some States, with the aim of creating new empires, at the expense of smaller States and in violation of international law.
Fourthly, despite the declared intention of the Secretary-General to proceed with the much-needed reform and modernization of the Organization, as well as its modus operandi and decision-making processes, the lack of willingness on the part of the States I referred to has not allowed for the implementation of such a change.
Fifthly, as a result of the same political expediencies, the United Nations, unfortunately, adopts an equal-distance stance, even when faced with the violation of decisions, resolutions and defined scope and terms of reference specified to the Secretariat. That results in emboldening offending States, which not only disregard international law but also create new precedents outside the framework of legality.
I have set out the main reasons for the lack of effectiveness, as well as the weakness, of the United Nations in living up to the expectations of billions of people. I know that I may be considered a romantic ideologist, but I believe that the recent events and problems affecting the world do not leave any choice other than to take bold, but necessary decisions.
The first decision is to ensure the identification of the causes that lead to unnecessary rivalries and conflicts and the renewal of our commitment to a global order based on international law — a global order that ensures that peace, security, human rights and sustainable development remain the highest values, which we undertake to preserve and hold.
The second decision is to ensure the political will and determination to proceed with the reform and modernization of the United Nations into a just and efficient multilateral governance system. That reform and modernization process becomes even more imperative and urgent with the imminent danger, after 77 years, of a new world war following the Russian aggression and Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine.
My reference to the need for reforms to the structure and implementation mechanism of decisions taken by the United Nations arises not only from my assessment as to other international problems, but also from what my country still endures and suffers as a result of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974.
It is with deep disappointment that I heard President Erdogan claiming that
“As a country, Tiirkiye wants all the issues in the Aegean Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean to be resolved within the framework of good-neighbourly relations and in conformity with international law.” (A/77/PV.4, p.24).
How ironic is it for the Turkish President to put forward such a claim when every day he threatens to overtake Greek islands, or when he commits thousands of violations of the airspace of the sovereign and neighbouring country, contrary to international law? How even more provocative is it to express the desire to resolve disputes “in conformity with international law” when he refuses to implement numerous resolutions of the United Nations on the Cyprus problem and creates new faits accompli? How much in conformity with international law is his refusal to abide by, first, resolution 3212 (XXIX), adopted in October 1974, which urges the speedy withdrawal of all foreign armed forces and foreign military presence and personnel from the Republic of Cyprus and the cessation of all foreign interference in its affairs; secondly, resolution 365 (1974), which was endorsed by the Security Council in December of the same year; and thirdly, Security Council resolution 1251 (1999), which reaffirms the Council’s position that a Cyprus settlement must be based on a State of Cyprus with a single sovereignty, international personality and citizenship, with its independence and territorial integrity safeguarded in a bizonal, bicommunal federation? The latter resolution also stresses that such a settlement must exclude union, in whole or in part, with any other country or any form of partition or secession.
Last year, Mr. Erdogan claimed that efforts should concentrate on reaching a settlement based on the so- called realities on the ground (see A/76/PV.3), while this year he spoke about the need for everyone to “see the truth” and that there were “two distinct States and two distinct peoples on the island today”.
I am wondering as to which truth is he talking about? Is it the truth that 37 per cent of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus, a State member of the European Union, remains under military occupation? Is it the truth that, after the Turkish invasion of 1974, one third of Greek Cypriots were forced to leave their ancestral homes? Is it the truth that they have implanted hundreds of thousands of Turkish nationals in the occupied areas, thereby altering the demographic character of the island, turning the Turkish Cypriots into a minority in the areas that they illegally occupy? Is it the truth that Turkey established an illegal entity in the occupied areas, which is under its absolute political, economic, social, cultural and religious control — an illegal entity, bear in mind, described by the European Court of Human Rights as a subordinate local administration of Turkey? Is it the truth that Turkey tries to equate the State, the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus, with the illegal secessionist entity?
Is it the truth that that proclamation of the purported secession was condemned by the Security Council and considered legally invalid? Is it the truth that the Security Council called for its reversal and for all States and the international community as a whole not to accept it or in any way assist it? Is it the truth that it is trying to change the status of the fenced city of Famagusta, contrary to Security Council resolutions 550 (1983) and 789 (1992)? Is it the ruth that Turkey adopts its own arbitrary interpretation of international law, which reduces the exclusive economic zone of Cyprus by 44 per cent, at the expense of both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, contrary to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea?
As I noted earlier, when decisions or resolutions based on international law are not implemented or enforced, that, rightly so, could be perceived as fostering, or even rewarding, arbitrariness. That is what we are actually witnessing today with the Cyprus problem. Turkey, which systematically violates international law, calls on the international community to recognize its illegal faits accompli.
Unfortunately, that was the long-standing aim of Turkey ever since 1956. That is why, despite
the historical compromises by the Greek Cypriot side, all efforts to reach a settlement of the Cyprus problem failed as a result of the intransigent stance and irrational demands of Turkey. The latest example of this was the Conference on Cyprus held at Crans-Montana in July 2017. In his report dated 28 September 2017, the Secretary-General offered his assessment of the proceedings at Crans-Montana with regard to the internal aspects of the Cyprus problem, stating that,
“[t]he core outstanding issues related to governance and power-sharing remained few ...” (S/2017/814, para. 20)
and that
“[b]y the time the Conference closed, the sides had essentially solved the key issue of effective participation” (ibid., para. 27).
Therefore, while the aim of the Secretary-General to reach a strategic agreement was within close reach, the reason for the unsuccessful outcome was Turkey’s inflexible stance and its insistence on maintaining the anachronistic Treaty of Guarantee, the right of intervention and a permanent presence of troops. I would further like to recall the Secretary-General’s statement in June 2017, in which he stressed that,
“Progress in this chapter [on security and guarantees] is an essential element in reaching an overall agreement”.
Following a period of stalemate and despite our disappointment, we undertook new initiatives to resume the process where it was left off at Crans-Montana, culminating in the joint understanding reached with the Secretary-General and the then-leader of the Turkish Cypriots on 25 November 2019, which reaffirmed the principles for the resumption of a new round of talks, namely, the Joint Declaration of 11 February 2014, the prior convergences and the six-point framework the Secretary-General presented at Crans-Montana.
Regrettably, once again, Turkey undermined the prospect of resuming the negotiating process and, instead, at the meeting held in Geneva in April 2021, the Turks presented their position, which was to change the agreed basis of a settlement from a federal solution to a two-State solution.
Nonetheless, our side undertook another initiative, which also led to a new joint meeting of the leaders of the two communities with the Secretary-General in September 2021, during which it was agreed that the Secretary-General would proceed with the appointment of an envoy in order to deliberate with both sides and all interested parties, so as to reach common ground for a new peace process to resume. Yet again, Turkey refused to uphold said agreement.
We also continued taking initiatives to break the impasse, including through a letter I sent to the Turkish Cypriot leader on 23 May 2022, by which I conveyed constructive proposals for the adoption of bold win-win confidence-building measures — measures that were immediately rejected by the Turkish Cypriot side, which submitted counter-proposals in line with their aim for a two-State solution.
Mrs. Gonzalez Lopez (El Salvador), Vice-President,
took the Chair.
Based on the foregoing, I believe that it is clear that the Greek Cypriot community has exerted and will continue to exert every possible effort for the resumption of talks, in order to reach a settlement based on the United Nations resolutions. And as I have emphasized, the only way forward in resolving conflicts and for peace to prevail is none other than the unwavering adherence to international law and the United Nations Charter — and not as arbitrarily interpreted by those who seek to disguise their revisionist aspirations.
During my 10-year tenure as President of Cyprus, I may not have been able to enjoy what the vast majority would have also wished to see: the necessary reforms of this international Organization, the resolution of international conflicts and the tackling of such challenges that affect hundreds of millions of people as hunger, poverty and climate change. I may have not been able to see my homeland reunited, with my Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot compatriots living in conditions of peace, prosperity and stability, but I earnestly hope that, during my lifetime, I will be able to witness a better and more stable future for humankind.

Czechia,CZE,Europe,"  10,666,000 ",31089,2.890000105,7.0,79.222,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,1302,12.21,"  10,666,000 ",100.00,11.12,"The United Nations and its principles, which we established after the Second World War, are in grave danger. One of the presumed gatekeepers of the Charter of the United Nations — one of the permanent members of the Security Council, Russia — is attacking a sovereign neighbouring democracy and wreaking havoc in Eastern Europe and the entire world. If we continue to allow a new colonial war, then why are we here? Why do we keep the United Nations alive? Do we care or are we indifferent?
The Czech Government’s foreign policy is guided by the legacy of our former President Vaclav Havel — a globally respected human rights defender and renowned politician, who once said,
“Our indifference towards others can, after all, result in only one thing — the indifference of others towards us”.
The fact that representatives of all States Members of the United Nations meet here to address major global challenges demonstrates that we are not indifferent to the suffering of others. It shows that we care.
The circumstances have changed dramatically since the seventy-sixth session of the General Assembly. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has fundamentally shaken the international order. On 24 February, not only Europe but also the whole world entered a new era. Russia tried to dismantle the security architecture of the European continent by launching a colonial war of conquest. Ironically, President Putin is declaring partial mobilization and threatening the world with the use of nuclear weapons today — the International Day of Peace. What more proof do we need? That is our terrifying new reality.
Russia’s unjustifiable, unprovoked and illegal war of aggression against Ukraine not only blatantly violates the United Nations Charter but also badly damages the global economy and the food security of many countries represented in the General Assembly Hall. It seriously threatens the rules-based international order and harms all States Members of the United Nations. I am shocked to the core, listening to Russian State-controlled television channels, preaching the strategy of hunger and cold towards Ukraine and the world and approving the torture and mass killing of civilians, with the argument that the world must fear Russia.
Russia must immediately cease its military actions and withdraw all its troops from the entire territory of Ukraine. Russia’s complete disregard for the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly is appalling. Czechia resolutely supports Ukraine’s right to defend its territorial integrity and population, in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.
Czechia fully supports the sovereignty, unity and independence of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders. We will never recognize the illegal annexation of Crimea. We condemn in the strongest possible terms the upcoming sham referendums to be held in parts of the territory of Ukraine. We resolutely reject attempts to create spheres of influence instead of equal partnerships. The time of establishing colonies and acquiring territory by the sheer force of arms is over. Today it is Ukraine; tomorrow it could be any of us. We refuse a world of Russian colonial appetite.
We are horrified by the atrocities committed by the Russian invader. We condemn the existence of filtration camps run by Russia and the horrors in Mariupol, Bucha, Irpin, Izyum and many other places in Ukraine, as well as the apocalyptic shelling of civilian infrastructure.
Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian citizens have been deported to Russia, including children. Children were forcibly taken from their parents. It reminds us of the worst practices of the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany in the first half of the twentieth century.
All those reports on Russian military conduct must be independently investigated. Russia must respect its obligations under international humanitarian law. Russia has an international responsibility for the aggression, but there is also an individual criminal responsibility for the crimes committed on such a large scale by Russian troops. We will hold all war criminals accountable.
Czechia supported the referral to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to open an investigation of the situation on the ground in Ukraine. We also strongly support Ukraine’s application instituting
proceedings against the Russian Federation under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide before the International Court of Justice. And we call for the establishment of a special international tribunal that will prosecute the crime of aggression committed by Putin’s Russia.
Apart from that, we support Ukraine comprehensively. Czechia hosts the highest number of Ukrainian refugees per capita — more than 400,000 in a country of 10 million. We provide large amounts of humanitarian aid. We support the stabilization, recovery and reconstruction efforts of the Ukrainian Government — not only with words but with action.
Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has only strengthened my country’s resolve to continue supporting independent media, civil society and human rights defenders.
Unfortunately, inside Russia the human rights situation of freedom-loving citizens has worsened enormously. We successfully ran for the Human Rights Council seat vacated by Russia in May. I would like to express thanks for the broad support that we received from many of Member States.
We warmly welcome the appointment of Mr. Volker Turk as the new United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. I wish to thank former High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet for her dedicated work during her term in office. The most recent report on China prepared by her Office shed light on the alarming human rights violations against Muslim groups, including Uyghurs.
Unfortunately, the human rights situations in countries such as Afghanistan, Cuba, Ethiopia, Iran, Myanmar and Venezuela also continue to worsen.
We wish Myanmar would work towards a peaceful resolution of the current crisis.
We follow with horror the atrocious manner in which the Iranian authorities handle the rightful protests of women.
In Belarus, the regime uses brutal violence against its opponents. In the past two years, tens of thousands of Belarussians have been detained and all independent media and civil society organizations have been destroyed.
We are concerned that anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial are on the rise. This year marks 80 years since the infamous Wannsee Conference and the formulation of the so-called “final solution to the Jewish question”, which resulted in the murder of nearly 6 million Jews.
Czechia reiterates Israel’s right to protect its citizens against any terrorist activities that deliberately target Israeli civilians, including rocket attacks.
Czechia currently holds the presidency of the European Union (EU). Our priorities, such as defending Ukraine, ensuring energy security and promoting democracy and human rights, are not only regional but also global in nature.
Russian aggression has only multiplied the already existing global challenges. Progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and global recovery from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has slowed down. The prices of agriculture commodities are growing globally.
For us, working with young people and listening to their concerns is the driving force to get progress on the SDGs back on track.
Climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss are major global challenges. We need a comprehensive humanitarian, development-oriented and peace-based response to crises, including pandemics, as well as solutions that foster sustainable food systems and climate resilience.
It is our collective responsibility to ensure that the World Health Organization can work effectively and independently of any political influence. No one should be left behind. We firmly support the global efforts for equal access to vaccines and treatment.
The stakes are high for the upcoming twenty- seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Egypt. It has been said many times before, but I will reiterate it once again: if we do not act now, it may soon be too late,
The development of relations between the European Union and Africa is among the priorities of the Czech EU presidency. Africa faces food shortages, the negative impacts of climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. The Russian aggression against Ukraine has blocked the exports of agricultural products.
I cannot but express my outrage at how Russian disinformation propaganda seeks to use the food crisis in Africa to spread false narratives that the EU sanctions
against Russia caused the shortage. Obviously, if Russia had not invaded Ukraine, we would not have had to deal with that issue at all.
Turning to other security issues, we are concerned about the increased tensions in the Taiwan Strait caused by unilateral threatening actions. We expect cross-strait differences to be resolved by peaceful means, while the status quo is maintained.
The digital space carries many opportunities, but there are risks too: cyberattacks and cybercrime, the misuse of technology and in particular disinformation. Let me say this loud and clear — a lie is not an opinion. For far too long, we have overlooked the spread of disinformation directed against our common values.
Let us not forget the COVID-related disinformation. We had to learn the hard way when disinformation began to cost human lives.
That is why we need to make sure that our citizens and societies are resilient and that independent media operate freely. We will continue to reach out and help countries exposed to lies and propaganda.
Czechia promotes the concept of digital humanism, which keeps human interests and needs at the centre of emerging technologies. Instances of Internet shutdowns are growing. We must maintain a free, open, safe, secure and stable cyberspace, in which human rights apply online as they do offline.
The number of cyberattacks, including State-sponsored cyberattacks, continues to rise, as does their severity. The new potential of terrorist threat has appeared with the escalation of Russia’s aggressive policies. Terrorism maliciously feeds on weak governance, economic hardship and social injustice, with the Sahel region being the most-affected region.
Czechia reiterates its commitment to countering terrorism and supporting countries that suffer from terrorist violence or threats.
I would like to use this opportunity to remind Russia that Czechia still awaits its official response concerning the explosion that occurred in an ammunition depot in my country in 2014. That completely appalling act was planned and executed by agents of GRU, the Russian military intelligence directorate, and claimed the lives of two innocent Czech citizens, in addition to the material damage caused. Such conduct is a clear violation of international law.
The non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is also negatively impacted by Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. Russia does not hesitate to use dangerous nuclear rhetoric, which has become a new standard for terrorizing peaceful populations.
Czechia strongly denounces Russia’s occupation of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. Any armed attack on nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful purposes constitutes a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
We regret that, despite lengthy negotiations, it was not possible to achieve consensus on a final outcome document at the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) because Russia opposed it.
And we call on Iran to act urgently to fulfil its legal obligations under its NPT Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement and to clarify all outstanding issues. We commend the IAEA and its Director General for their professional work in verifying Iran’s safeguards obligations.
The United Nations, this universal Organization, has a duty to help us better react to existing and emerging global challenges. But in these dark and stormy times, it has the duty to firmly defend the principles it was founded on — the Charter of the United Nations, human rights and the rules-based international order."
Denmark,DNK,Europe,"  5,752,000 ",45141,5.739999771,7.6,80.784,Neoplasm,Cardiovascular Disease,Dementia,617,10.73,"  5,752,000 ",100.00,11.10,"As we gather for the seventy-seventh opening of the General Assembly, the unique and indispensable convening power of the United Nations is evident for all of us to see. Having listened to addresses and statements from leaders from around the world, it is equally clear that the Charter of the United Nations continues to inspire and fill us with hope for a better world.
And, still, our world is in crisis. We are, in the words of the Secretary-General, “gridlocked in colossal global dysfunction” (A/77/PV.4, p. 2). Six months ago, war erupted again in Europe. Unprovoked, Russia attacked Ukraine, a neighbour shared by Russia and Europe. The military aggression is a vicious onslaught on the people of Ukraine. Their resilience and bravery in the face of brutality is awe-inspiring.
Throughout the week, we have heard many perspectives on the Russian aggression. We have heard the concerns of fellow Member States geographically remote from the war, worried about being caught in the middle of a new Cold War. And we have heard the despair over the consequences on food supplies and energy prices worldwide. We acknowledge those concerns, but we also feel the need to stress that they are caused by the Russian aggression, not by international sanctions.
Importantly, we have heard no one — apart from a few self-interested voices — denying the obvious: that Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is a direct violation of the United Nations Charter. Let me therefore be clear: Russia’s invasion of a neighbouring State, President Putin’s blatant imperial ambitions and his horrifying allusions to using nuclear weapons are unprecedented threats against not only Europe, but international peace and security. We are extremely concerned.
So, yes, we rally fellow States Members of the United Nations to take a stand for the territorial integrity of Ukraine, just as Denmark has stood up in support of the independence and sovereignty of other nations throughout the history of the United Nations, against apartheid and for decolonization. This is an appeal to all Member States to stand firmly on the side of the United Nations Charter, to fight back against an international disorder where might makes right.
We appeal to the rest of the world to see Russia’s aggression for what it is: an attempt to expand its own territory by force, which is completely unacceptable, not just to European neighbours, who rightly worry that we could be next in line if Putin has his way in Ukraine, but also for all who believe in the sanctity of the Charter and the principles of territorial integrity and the political independence of sovereign States. We appeal for the understanding of the General Assembly as a whole: that a war in our backyard, initiated by a permanent member of the Security Council and a nuclear Power, and the resulting influx of millions of Ukrainian refugees to Europe, will obviously exhaust a great deal of our resources and political focus. That will inevitably be the case until the territorial integrity of Ukraine is restored and respected.
Nonetheless, we do not neglect other crises and global challenges. We know that our other joint challenges remain and have in many cases been aggravated by Russian acts of aggression. The most pressing crises of our time are all truly global. Climate, pandemic, violent conflict, instability, forced displacement, food insecurity — we feel them everywhere, regardless of where we live, in our everyday lives, as the price of food and energy rises, inequality increases and extreme weather and climate-induced disasters hit.
Yet, even as those events affect us all, there is no doubt that they are felt most strongly by the most vulnerable, the most fragile and the poorest among us. Developing countries are — unfairly and unjustly — hit the hardest by the global crises of our time. That was and is clearly the case with the coronavirus disease. The lingering repercussions of the pandemic continue to inflict human and economic wounds on societies in the global South.
Collectively, we must do more to address both the problems at hand and the fundamental imbalances of the world we share. And we must do it now, for the sake of both current and future generations. None of us can steer through pandemics or counter the climate crisis alone, and neither should we.
In the twenty-first century, it is — or rather, it should be — clear to us all that the future we share depends on solidarity and on our ability to address and overcome the fault lines and divisions that increasingly drive us apart. Solidarity is an investment in prosperity, in security, in peace. Denmark is one of very few countries that lives up to the United Nations official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent, and we have done so for more than 40 years.
More than anything, today we need climate solidarity. The industrialized world must acknowledge its responsibility to deliver on the climate crisis. Climate solidarity means climate financing. As Denmark strives to reduce its own footprint, we have made major global commitments on climate adaptation and climate financing. We have massively scaled up Danish grant-based climate financing to at least $500 million a year by 2023. We are dedicating 60 per cent to adaptation in poor and vulnerable countries. And we are strengthening our efforts to mobilize public and private financing from other sources. In total, Denmark aims to contribute at least 1 per cent of the collective target of $100 billion dollars — way above our relative share — and we call on others to follow and to do so urgently. If a small country like Denmark can, the Group of 20 also can.
We also need to step up and listen to those affected the most by climate-induced damages. We were proud to be the first contributor to the Santiago Network for Averting, Minimizing and Addressing Loss and Damage at the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 26), and this week we have followed up with several new initiatives for those hardest hit and the world’s poorest. As we look towards COP 27, Denmark will also be among the founding members of the Systems Observations Financing Facility — an initiative taken by Secretary-General Guterres to ensure that early- warning services reach everyone in the next five years. It is a small step, but it is important, because it will make a difference in the lives of people and societies living on the brink.
The United Nations most essential task is to save the world from the scourge of war. That might sound like a lofty ideal, but in essence it is about providing space for difficult conversations, restoring trust and finding spaces for common ground on those issues where we stand far apart. The United Nations needs to deliver on that, but the United Nations is all of us, and the United Nations is only as good as what we as Member States put into it. We all need to put in the work and take responsibility to ensure that the trenches between us do not grow deeper. There is no free ride on multilateralism. We must not neglect to maintain and protect the global common that the United Nations is. Denmark is ready to do its part.
Just a few hours ago, Denmark announced that it is running for a seat on the Security Council for the period of 2025 to 2026. If elected to the Security Council, Denmark will do all it can to help ensure that the Council fulfils its vital mandate of maintaining international peace and security. As a small country with a long history of global engagement and international solidarity, Denmark takes pride in being a bridge builder. We know — simply by virtue of our smallness — that if we want to achieve anything, we must work with others. And we must do so on the basis of partnership and dialogue. We pursue cooperation where all voices are heard. We seek honest conversations with partners about the challenges we face. And we work to find ways of confronting them together. That is the spirit of cooperation, and we hope to bring that spirit also to the Security Council.
Our candidature is a natural extension of our long-standing and unwavering commitment to multilateralism in general and to the United Nations in particular. We all need a United Nations-system that is fit for the future and able to deliver effectively for today. Denmark is a long-time advocate for United Nations reforms — both at the highest level and in everyday workings of the Organization. We championed the reform of the United Nations development system. We continue to support the implementation of the reforms, both financially and politically.
Earlier this week, we launched the Pledge to Predictable Payments initiative. It is a small, yet pragmatic step, paving the way for a United Nations that is better able to act. We urge all delegations to help the United Nations help us all, by recommitting to the goal of making our payment patterns predictable and transparent. Giving the United Nations that predictable and transparent ability is a small act with no cost to us as individual Member States, but it is of significant value to the United Nations ability to serve us.
The United Nations, however, also needs more fundamental reform. In particular, it needs a Security Council that better reflects the world of today. During the seventy-sixth session of the General Assembly, Denmark co-facilitated the intergovernmental negotiations on
Security Council reform. We will continue to advocate for reform towards a more accountable, representative, transparent and effective Council.
That also means that, even as we call on fellow Member States to stand up for the Charter of the United Nations and its universal principles and aspirations, we must not settle for simply defending the status quo. We need to do more. We need to do better. And we need to do it together.
The good news is that we know what needs to be done. The Secretary-General has presented us with a sobering analysis of the state of the world in Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) and presented a clear path forward. Denmark fully supports the Secretary- General’s vision and remains unwavering in its commitment to a revitalized multilateralism with the United Nations at its centre. We look forward to working with fellow Member States in translating that vision into reality. And we will do our part to ensure that we — as a collective — make the most of the upcoming sister summits: the Sustainable Development Goal summit in September 2023 and the Summit of the Future in 2024, because those two agendas — the 2030 Agenda and Our Common Agenda — are mutually reinforcing.
The twin agendas and the sister summits provide us not only with a sense of direction, but also with the tools to get there if we work together. Moving forward together on the twin agendas of those summits provides a way out of the current gridlock of global dysfunction, a way for us to live up to the expectations of future generations.
And let us not forget that this remains the decade of action, so let us act."
Dominican Republic,DOM,North America,"  10,627,000 ",14088,5.486000061,5.4,73.892,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Road Injuries,530,4.99,"  10,627,000 ",100.00,6.56,"I begin my statement by conveying the apologies of our President, Mr. Luis Abinader Corona, who, for unexpected reasons resulting from Hurricane Fiona, which has severely affected several provinces of our country, was unable to participate in this important general debate.
I cannot continue without first expressing our condolences to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as well as to the members and observers of the Commonwealth of Nations, on the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Her example of dedication to public service will be remembered forever.
After a painful period, which left millions of victims, we are once again in this great setting, since, thanks to science, we have managed to overcome the worst effects of the coronavirus disease. But who would have foreseen that, in the twenty-first century, the spectre of war would once again haunt Europe? It has been a severe test, and we will hopefully learn lessons that better prepare us for the challenges ahead.
Those would be preventable situations if there were the will to work together to find answers to the pressing problems facing humankind. That should be clear to us by now because, in a globalized world, there are no borders when it comes to the effects of epidemics, conflicts and violence. Precisely because ours is such an intertwined world, far-reaching goals always require “transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, as the theme of this session of the General Assembly aptly puts it.
It is essential to recognize that this Organization needs major reforms to shake it out of the comfort in which it has been operating. It must be stressed that what is important to our countries is to consolidate a renewed multilateralism. As part of a substantive reform, the General Assembly must be given greater powers and participation in order to reduce the excessive use of the veto in the Security Council, especially when it comes to issues involving human rights violations and support for humanitarian assistance.
Another pressing issue is climate change and its devastating effects, which call for proactive solidarity with those that are the least able to deal with it effectively. As an island, our country is ready to make concrete proposals in the context of the twenty- seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Naturally, our positions, as small island developing States, demand that the countries that contribute most to global warming maintain on their agendas a vital cooperation mechanism with those that suffer the most from the effects of climate change. We therefore seek a greater commitment to funding for adaptation and mitigation given the crisis.
Small countries, such as ours, are significantly increasing their education programmes, at the expense of other essential aspects of development. For that reason, we attach particular importance to the Summit on Transforming Education and the establishment of the United Nations Youth Office and Youth Mobilization Day. Our country has a population of 70 per cent young people. We believe in their meaningful, full and equal participation in decision-making.
Today humankind needs results that promote peace and prevent new conflicts, especially those that pose a threat to the very existence of the planet. The Dominican Republic therefore supports the total elimination of nuclear weapons and, as proof of that,
tomorrow we will deposit our instrument of ratification for the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
As part of that commitment to multilateralism and a greater presence in the community of international organizations, our country is seeking a seat on the Human Rights Council for the period from 2024 to 2026. It is our genuine desire to be part of that Council for the first time and, to that end, we hope to have the support of this community of nations.
The twenty-first century ushered in many positive developments to improve the living conditions of all humankind, but, unfortunately, events such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have created not only distress due to the loss of human lives, but also a dangerous increase in hunger in various regions, many of which are far removed from that conflict. With Russia and Ukraine being the world’s main producers of grain and fertilizers, the conflict has jeopardized the global distribution of that important food source, not to mention how Europe is being affected by shortages of fuel, of which Russia is a major supplier.
We welcome the Security Council’s extension of the mandate of the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH) until July 2023, including the establishment of a unit to deal with sexual and gender-based violence, one of the most abhorrent manifestations of that violent context.
The expected results of BINUH are dependent, first, on Haitians reaching a national agreement as a starting point to combat and rein in the gangs and, secondly, on ensuring the holding of elections as soon as conditions allow.
Unfortunately, that approach has not succeeded. In that regard, the Dominican Republic believes that, as we have reiterated numerous times, stabilization efforts in Haiti must be focused on immediate peacemaking and political dialogue as the only appropriate means to deal with the violence and disorder.
As the Special Representative of the Secretary- General for Haiti has stated, I would like to reiterate that criminal gangs have increased their suffocating grip on Port-au-Prince, and everything suggests that the Haitian National Police does not have the capacity to contain them. It is the responsibility of the Haitian authorities to control and put an end to the gang activity that is resulting in crimes so heinous they may amount to crimes against humanity.
We must take off our blindfolds and acknowledge that the Haitian National Police alone is not able to carry out the capacity-building necessary to maintain order and subdue the gangs. Security Council resolution 2645 (2022) puts us in a position to implement that necessary process and to take the decisions most needed for preventing the situation in Haiti from completely exceeding the reach of normal channels. The paragraphs of the resolution are indeed binding, and I would therefore like to highlight the following.
First, we need to ban without delay the illicit transfer and trafficking of small arms, light weapons and ammunition to anyone who participates in or supports gang violence, criminal activities or human rights abuses in Haiti.
Secondly, we emphasize the importance of taking appropriate measures, including by freezing the assets or banning the travel of those involved in promoting the state of violence and terror prevailing in Haiti and affecting the entire region.
Thirdly, the actions to be taken by the Secretary- General with regard to enhancing security support for the Haitian National Police’s efforts to combat the high levels of violence, as stipulated in paragraph 10 of resolution 2645 (2022), must be carried out with the urgency they demand.
Fourthly, an urgent Haitian-led political agreement needs to be reached by all the parties concerned with a view to organizing legislative and presidential elections that include the full participation of the entire population, especially that of women, young people and civil society.
In that regard, we consider it important to strongly endorse what Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated in his interview on French television on 18 September — that it is imperative to address the security situation in Haiti and that, in addition to capacity-building for police training, what is needed is a robust police force that is capable of restoring peace and putting an end to the violence perpetrated by armed gangs, which have permeated the political and economic power structures.
We have asked ourselves on many occasions whether the most catastrophic event for the Haitian people was the 2010 earthquake that devastated Port- au-Prince, causing the death of some 220,000 people, including 102 United Nations staff members, or the
current situation, which may be characterized as a low-intensity conflict. The answer, I have no doubt, is that, despite the horrible suffering caused by the earthquake, the current situation is more desperate for the Haitian people.
In the face of the earthquake in 2010, all Haitians came together in solidarity as one people and worked to support and rescue their neighbours. Similarly, concerted action was also taken at the global level to deliver relief to Haiti. The Dominican people of course immediately came to the aid of our Haitian brothers and sisters. In addition to the natural disasters it has faced, in 1986 Haiti’s entire population, compelled by its civic spirit, came together to end the dictatorship that had lasted there for more than two decades. In other words, the Haitian people have historical experience in uniting together to face adversity.
Today the situation is dramatically different. Faced with the inability of the authorities to establish order and ensure public security, most people are paralysed with fear and, as a result, the resilient Haitian population feels abandoned to its own fate. The violence, which has created deep fragmentations in society, makes even the most basic social cohesion impossible, while Haitians are left to wait in despair for the delayed help of the international community. As President Abinader Corona said last year in his address to the General Assembly, Haiti can wait no longer (see A/76/PV.9). We must act responsibly, and we must act now.
The Dominican Republic reaffirms its belief that the only way to secure a lasting and sustainable response to the Haitian crisis is to ensure that it comes from Haitian people themselves. Despite the difficulties in reaching agreements, we urge and hope for that to happen so as to enable the people of Haiti to take the path required for achieving the consensus needed in their society to overcome such a grave situation. International collaboration is vital if we are to successfully bring stability and peace to the people of Haiti, its neighbours and the region. That is our only objective.
The Dominican Republic was a signatory to the Charter of the United Nations in 1945 and continues to fulfil its obligations with the same sense of responsibility with which it has done so for 77 years. We have played a role in the General Assembly’s adoption of historic decisions and resolutions. The Assembly can rest assured that our country will continue to play its part in the concert of nations. We stand ready to continue contributing to the strengthening of the United Nations, an instrument that continues to be fundamental to the maintenance of world peace and security."

Like many Latin American migrants, Mateo was focused on pursuing his dreams — in his case, a medical degree from Zaporizhzhya National University. One day in February, however, that dream became a nightmare, all because of Russia’s senseless war against Ukraine. As the entire world, flabbergasted, watched the outbreak of a war of dimensions that had not been seen for decades, Mateo had to experience it first-hand. He came in very close proximity to dangerous military actions that I prefer not to discuss today, out of respect for him and his traumatic experience. Relying on his own ingenuity and the solidarity of others, he used various means of transport, including horses, to make his way to the nearest border.
Meanwhile, as all of that was going on, Ecuador was establishing a national crisis committee, which fulfilled its objective of repatriating 730 Ecuadorian citizens via humanitarian flights. Mateo, whose sister is Ecuadorian, thereby making him part of a transnational family, was able to board one of those flights. His Colombian parents now live in Ecuador, thanks to protection visas granted by our Government. And Mateo was not the only one — that same story was experienced by several Colombian, Peruvian, Latin American and even Ukrainian citizens who managed to escape the war thanks to the enormous diplomatic effort led by our country. I am relating all of this now because if everyone here takes only one message from me with them today, I would like it to be this — that Ecuador is here for the world and will leave no one behind. That is why I am confident that the world will not leave Ecuador behind when it comes to the challenges we face.
When I prepare for events like these, I usually consult with renowned international relations experts. They cite to me the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, which speak of the sovereign equality of States; good faith; the peaceful settlement of disputes; territorial integrity and political independence; the non-use of force; full respect for human rights and so on and so forth. Those are all admirable concepts that for almost eight decades have preserved a relative stability that is now being challenged. Nevertheless, I wanted to begin my address by talking about Mateo, a Latin American student who, like thousands of others, was in Ukraine chasing a dream. Those who know me know that I am neither a scholar nor an academic nor a regular speaker at international forums. The reality is that for most of my life, I have cultivated a very simple idea, which is that the only way to create value is to always put people — human beings — first in everything we do. It is always in human beings — in people — that I place my trust, and I want to explain exactly why that is important.
I want to explain the reasons why I argue that a people-first approach is vital not only to individual countries but also to building a more peaceful and stable world. I firmly believe that any political institution or system, whether national or international, derives its legitimacy from the good it is able to produce for its citizens. It must not only base its legitimacy on that principle but renew it daily with the consent of the people it serves. Here in this great institution, we are a family of nations, and nations are families of citizens. The welfare of our larger, extended family — as well as its stability and, ultimately, its peace — depends on what happens within each of our smaller, immediate families. Take it from someone who leads a country today where in the past, marginality and neglect have served as breeding grounds for the magic formulas of the most predictable kind of populism.
I refer here to the same populism that subsequently takes off the mask and shows its true authoritarian face; the same populism that when it is governing, flirts with dangerous actors who hide beyond the reach of our international institutions to sponsor some of the threats that bring us here today, when we ask ourselves what to do about them. That challenge is multifaceted, but I will always insist that if we want to keep those threats at bay, we must start by shunning the ugly face of authoritarianism. In order to do that, we will always circle back to the need to create opportunities for the
people themselves. We need a world order in which all citizens feel included, connected and represented; an interdependent order where opportunities flow freely from one corner of the world to another. We need to strike a balance whereby it becomes increasingly difficult for aspiring warlords to blame their failures on so-called asymmetries in the world order. We must open the doors of opportunity to more citizens and never again close them behind a false notion of sovereignty that in reality is simply hubris. We need to understand that international security is not a right to simply be demanded, but a duty that we all share.
My Government has in fact found itself in a strange position whereby it has had to inaugurate a fight against a threat that in the past was concealed rather than confronted. I am talking about shady actors who, rather than being countered, were quietly accommodated in hopes that no one would detect them. Today Ecuador is engaged head-on in an unprecedented fight against drug trafficking, as evidenced by the latest World Drug Report 2022, which confirms that Ecuador is third in the world among countries seizing cocaine. Today as never before we are increasing our activities to maximize narcotics seizures and dismantle the transnational gangs that transport them. We know that we are not the only ones fighting that monster, which incidentally has not one but several heads, including human trafficking, money-laundering, illegal arms trafficking and even illegal mining. It is estimated that transnational crime is shifting between $1.6 and $2.2 trillion in a year — a figure dozens of times the size of the economy of a country like Ecuador.
But it would be a mistake to quantify the consequences of transnational crime in economic terms alone. They must be measured above all in irreparable losses, in lives taken and dreams cut short, in the heartrending cries of the families affected, but also in the fearful silence that they impose on some communities. Just two days ago, in the very centre of the city of Guayaquil, where I was born, a prosecutor was cowardly gunned down by organized crime assassins. He was an official whose investigations included major cases involving transnational mafias. His assassination means not only that Ecuador has lost a servant of the law but also that his children will grow up without a father. His murder teaches us an additional lesson, which is that transnational crime requires a transnational solution. We have two options in that regard. Either we suffer separately, due to a coordinated enemy that acts within several countries to make a mockery of our laws, or we unite to defeat it. Recent events have made it clear that we need even greater collaboration, and I will never tire of insisting on that. Ecuador, with its record levels of drug seizures but also the sacrifices of its servants, has proved that it deserves international help and support in its fight against drug trafficking and to strengthen the institutions where those officers are based.
I would also like to take advantage of this forum to appeal for us to work together in the fight against gender-based violence. For Ecuador, the disappearance of a brave woman, a lawyer, a mother and a daughter, should serve as a symbol of the challenge of ending violence against women. Ecuador has shown that it is here for the world, and I am confident that the world will reciprocate that support in those challenges.
In terms of human mobility, we have taken decisions that have been applauded. Not only have we maintained our long history as a country of transit, reception and refuge for migrants, we have traditionally been among the States receiving the largest number of refugees in the entire Western hemisphere. And beyond that act of reception, I would like to point to the treatment that those refugees receive once they set foot on Ecuadorian soil. We make special efforts to guarantee the rights and, above all, the integration of migrants, particularly when it comes to families whose countries of origin offer no life alternatives beyond simply fleeing those nations. With half a million Venezuelans living in Ecuador today, we are one of the three principal hosts of migrants from that country. Despite our budgetary difficulties, we provide them with health care, education and other social services. We have also begun a broad regularization process. I would ask everyone here to think about what that means for a small country like ours and then about the impact that a population of that size would have on their own country. That is why I reiterate that Ecuador is here for the world and that I am confident that the world will support us in our regularization plan for our Venezuelan brothers and sisters who have had to leave their country.
I have firm hopes that this will be the case, but that is not the only issue at hand. Ecuador is also playing its part in confronting the climate crisis. As a country that emits greenhouse gases, we account for only 0.8 per cent of global emissions. Nevertheless, without hesitation or waiting for anyone to suggest it, my Government took the decision to make Ecuador the first country in Latin America — and only the fourth in the world — to adopt
a cross-cutting policy on our ecological transition, including by elevating it to the ministerial level.
Climate change does not ask to what extent we have industrialized in the past but how much we can contribute to the future. That is why, almost a year ago, at the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Glasgow, I announced the creation of the new Hermandad marine reserve in the Galapagos Islands, which increases the protected area of that natural heritage of humankind by 60,000 square kilometres. That was complemented this year by the signing of a declaration for the conservation and management of the ecosystems that make up the Eastern Tropical Pacific Marine Corridor, which was signed with my fellow Presidents of Colombia, Costa Rica and Panama to lend a new dimension and political impetus to the corridor’s objectives. That is how we are opening up new opportunities for cooperation, funding and technical assistance for the conservation of biodiversity in Ecuador, the region and indeed the world. But we are going much further — within this very Organization, we have pushed for the mandate of the United Nations Environment Assembly to include the negotiation of a future treaty on plastic pollution. So when it comes environmental conservation, too, Ecuador is here for the world.
In each of the issues I have outlined and in each of the challenges and unknown scenarios that the future holds, Ecuador believes firmly that we will find the answers within ourselves, given our recognition that as human beings who share this Earth, what we have in common is far greater than what divides us. We may even be unaware that we hold in our own hands the keys to solving the problems faced by other peoples or individuals. In fact that is what happened to Mateo, the student we were able to rescue from Ukraine. If we apply that way of thinking to every challenge and if we only dare to approach every threat from a united perspective, I know that we will be able to go much further.
Take, for example, the food crisis, which has been aggravated by the conflict in Ukraine and has exacerbated malnutrition in many countries. International figures show that 52 million children under five are suffering from malnutrition, 17 million from severe malnutrition and 155 million from stunted growth. In Ecuador, the disease affects almost 30 per cent of children under the age of two, and in some even more tragic cases, some of our poorest provinces are seeing malnutrition rates of more than 35 per cent. My Government has been a pioneer in tackling that problem. We have created a technical secretariat, Ecuador Grows without Child Malnutrition, and set a very clear goal of reducing child malnutrition by six percentage points during my term of office and institutionalizing the process so that future Governments can continue that endeavour. To that end, we have encouraged the participation of civil society, academia, the private sector and local Government. But we can go much further if we only dare to think as a global community.
It is no secret that Ecuador’s lands can be extraordinarily fertile and productive when they are sown with optimism and dedication. We are the country of cocoa, bananas and shrimp, but also of dragon fruit, avocados and many other agricultural products. It makes no sense that our children, or those anywhere else in the world, should suffer from hunger in any context — even less so when the land is there, ready to be harvested not only for food but also for opportunities. Today’s new Ecuador offers advantages that can serve not only to alleviate hunger but to create a more stable and peaceful world, where citizens are increasingly included each day through the creation of opportunities. That is the world I see and the world that Ecuador proposes.
Finally, as former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said, peace is a way of being, of relating to others and of living on this planet. It cannot be decreed solely through treaties. It must be nurtured through the dignity, rights and capacities of every man and woman. I believe that those words, in a nutshell, encapsulate the spirit of what I have said today. I would also like to take this opportunity to express Ecuador’s support for the leadership of the current Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres.
I would like to conclude by thanking all Member States for their overwhelming support for my country’s election to be a member of the Security Council for the 2023-2024 term. We will undertake our membership in a context in which humankind is experiencing a period of great uncertainty and exceptional challenges. But I want to assure the Assembly that Ecuador will be here as always, doing its duty for the world. We will conduct ourselves with coherence and transparency and with an emphasis on supporting humanitarian assistance, peace operations, the protection of civilians in situations of armed conflict, the women and peace and security
agenda and the fight against arms trafficking, all while addressing emerging threats in the context of sustainable peace efforts.
In every decision, every mediation and every opportunity to contribute to the peace and stability of our planet, the President can rest assured that Ecuador will be here for its fellow Member States and their citizens. Ecuador will always be here for the world."
Egypt,EGY,Africa,"  98,424,000 ",11430,12.07900047,4.0,71.825,Cardiovascular Disease,Digestive Disease,Neoplasm,3022,3.07,"  98,424,000 ",100.00,6.53,"At the outset, I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its current session and wish you every success in presiding over its work.
The current session of the General Assembly is taking place at a delicate historic time. The international arena is witnessing intertwined crises of immense complexity, requiring concerted action to invigorate multilateralism, including, first and foremost, the United Nations system. As the world still suffers from the colossal consequences of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, successive geopolitical crises have raised international tensions to unprecedented levels. In the light of those delicate circumstances, Egypt would like to reflect on the current international landscape, the challenges faced by our world today and the means to confront them.
First, the United Nations system still faces the challenge of acting outside its working context. That undermines its capacity to take an effective international stance that supports the maintenance of international security and stability and promotes the development and prosperity of peoples of the world. It is unfortunate that our hopes have been dashed in terms of achieving, in the twenty-first century, a world of stability and renouncing tensions while establishing international systems based on respect for international law. Instead, we are surprised by a growing tendency towards polarization and confrontation rather than achieving complementarity to realize our common interests, or even to compete on the basis of justice leading to human advancement.
The United Nations system is further threatened by the use of double standards in dealing with similar crises even when acting outside its working context. What is an acceptable response for one crisis is considered rejected for another. Therefore, the flaws we are witnessing are not a feature of the United Nations system itself, but they reflect the will of certain members in the system.
As we meet in September of every year in this international forum, I call on all those gathered here to respect the United Nations system, with a view to reinvigorating and reforming it. That process should not remain incomplete. Instead, it should be addressed
seriously, objectively and fairly so that the United Nations can better respond to the challenges we face and become more flexible in meeting the demands and needs of our peoples. In that regard, Egypt reiterates its adherence to the African common position calling for reform of the Security Council, based on the Ezulwini Consensus and Sirte Declaration.
The Russian-Ukrainian crisis has further exacerbated the global economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic’s negative impact, coupled with successive geopolitical developments, has increased the burdens on the developing countries, especially pertaining to the sovereign debt crisis and soaring budget deficits. Developed countries therefore need to respond by launching a global initiative between creditor and debtor nations, to transform the bulk of debt into joint investment projects. That would create more job opportunities and contribute to economic growth.
The current international situation clearly indicates that the concept of international security is now closer to a system of balance of power than one of collective security. The international environment has been characterized by conflicts, not cooperation. We must therefore work to promote the spirit of international consensus to ensure the security of all States, without threatening or undermining each other’s security and safety. The current global challenges have threatened the very notion of the nation-State, interfering in its internal affairs and disrespecting the unique features of its society. They weaken the State entity and, at times, even disrupt it, which enables non-State actors such as terrorist groups and armed militias to control the fate and wealth of peoples. The nation-State and its institutions must be empowered to play their role at all levels to preserve and promote international peace and security.
There are many complex and intertwined challenges on the international scene with multiple repercussions, most notably the food security crisis, which is the result of the international community’s failure, over many years, to achieve Sustainable Development Goals, particularly the Goal seeking to eradicate hunger and achieve food security. In addition, the crisis has been exacerbated by the recent economic and geopolitical crises. Regrettably, in Africa alone, one in five people are at risk of hunger and the continent remains a net food importer, at an annual cost of $43 billion. We reiterate the need to confront the global food crisis by establishing an integrated strategy that addresses its root causes through developing sustainable farming and agricultural systems and meeting the urgent needs of food-importing developing countries. We also must ensure that their products have unimpeded access to the global supply chain, particularly through the development and transfer of agricultural technology. We also stress the importance of supporting early warning systems regarding food insecurity and promoting grain storage and exports. In that context, thanks to its unique geographical location, Egypt declares its readiness to cooperate with the international community to establish an international centre for storing, supplying and trading grains in Egypt, which will contribute to maintaining global food security.
The current session of the General Assembly is taking place under a theme that reflects our deep understanding of the crises and challenges the world is facing today. There is no doubt that the search for radical solutions to those interlocking crises is most applicable to the climate change crisis.
Egypt, in its capacity as President of the upcoming twenty-seventh session of the Conference of States Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 27), appeals sincerely to all members of the international community to translate our pledges and commitments into action and to support developing and least developed countries in their efforts to confront the devastating impacts of climate change. They are the most deserving and in need of such support on the basis of the principles of equity and common yet differentiated responsibilities.
During COP 27, which Egypt will host in a few weeks’ time, we look forward to reaching outcomes that contribute to accelerating the pace of implementation at all levels, consolidating the international community’s commitment to addressing climate change, including through emissions reduction, enhancing adaptation and tackling losses and damage due to climate change and, most important, raising climate financing ambitions. We must also commit to double adaptation financing and ensure $100 billion annually, as well as working towards a just transition to renewable energy.
The international community’s ability to move forward on implementing the goals of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, especially limiting the rise in global temperature, is closely linked to the achievement of tangible outcomes in Sharm El-Sheikh conference. That will demonstrate to our peoples that confronting climate change remains a top priority at the global level, among all other challenges that confront today’s world. In that context, Egypt reaffirms its steadfast commitment to providing all favourable conditions to that end.
Water security remains one of the most important challenges facing our world today, especially in the Middle East and the African continent, where some countries are located in the driest and most arid areas in the world. Unfortunately, that grave human suffering is not always due to a lack of resources or declining rainfall, but often to non-compliance with international law and to certain upstream countries monopolizing water resources and depriving downstream countries of the water that flows for the common good of all peoples.
Those who believe that resorting to peaceful means to settle water disputes is a form of weakness are mistaken. Such an approach is rooted in the strength and ability to protect and preserve the rights from loss or alienation. It is also based on a keen awareness by Governments of the negative impacts of conflict on people. In that context, after a decade of self-restraint, Egypt still recognizes the right of the Ethiopian people to development. However, that cannot be at the expense of the Egyptian people’s right to life and survival, which has been linked to the Nile River since the dawn of time. I reiterate the need to reach, without delay, a legally binding agreement regarding the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, in accordance with the Agreement on Declaration of Principles concluded by Egypt, the Sudan and Ethiopia in March 2015 in Khartoum and the presidential statement issued by the Security Council on 15 September 2021 (S/PRST/2021/18). As three sovereign States, they must respect what they agreed upon and implement their agreement through deeds, not just words, in order to maintain international peace and security. Egypt therefore calls on the international community, represented by the United Nations and the Security Council, as well as influential States at the international level, to implement international law in order to safeguard the rights and lives of 250 million Egyptian, Sudanese and Ethiopian citizens.
Reaching definitive solutions to the crises in our region remains an essential pillar of building a secure and stable international system. At the forefront of that is the need to reach a just, lasting and comprehensive solution to the Palestinian question, through negotiations on the basis of resolutions of international legitimacy and the two-State solution, in order to establish a Palestinian State along the 4 June 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Meanwhile, it is essential to refrain from any unilateral measures that would change the facts on the ground and undermine prospects for an ultimate solution.
Based on Egypt’s responsibility to support its brothers, we continue to support efforts to reach political solutions, in accordance with international terms of reference, in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and the Sudan in a manner that preserves the unity, integrity and sovereignty of those brotherly countries and puts an end to any external interference in their affairs.
Egypt continues to support the efforts of our brothers in Libya to establish the constitutional framework to allow for the simultaneous holding of presidential and parliamentary elections as soon as possible and ending the transitional period. In that regard, Egypt commends the role of the elected Libyan Parliament and stresses the importance of the withdrawal of all foreign forces and mercenaries from Libya, as well as the dismantling of armed militias within a specific time frame, in order to restore long-desired stability in Libya.
Our region has suffered for a long time, and it is high time to overcome the suffering, to prioritize peoples’ interests over personal ones that seek power and wealth and to end attempts to undermine our region’s unity and national security.
Before concluding, I would like to note in particular the importance of solidarity as a fundamental value of which we are in dire need, now more than ever before. The designation by the United Nations of 20 December as the annual International Human Solidarity Day reflects the importance of initiatives to eradicate poverty and celebrate unity in the context of diversity. It is also an indication that the United Nations believes in solidarity as an indispensable value, not only to effectively achieve the Sustainable Development Goals but also to counter emerging challenges and address economic gaps.
Solidarity remains a source of hope for a better tomorrow. That tomorrow cannot be achieved unless we all act together, hand in hand, to build and to banish all evil for peoples who seek coexistence and cooperation under the banner of human fraternity."
El Salvador,SLV,North America,"  6,421,000 ",8335,4.491000175,6.3,73.096,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Chronic Kidney Disease,391,6.09,"  6,421,000 ",100.00,7.64,"I bring the General Assembly greetings from the land of volcanoes, surfing, coffee, Bitcoin and freedom. Anyone who has been to El Salvador can easily confirm everything I have just mentioned. Our country is home to the world’s best surfing beaches, volcanoes are everywhere, we have incredible coffee, and anyone can walk around peacefully and safely in any corner of our country. Most of all, we are a united people who is fighting for its freedom. And freedom is precisely what I have come to the General Assembly to speak about from this rostrum.
I speak of the freedom for which my people and all the peoples of the world yearn. Talking about freedom is easy, but achieving it requires struggle, perseverance and much sacrifice. I speak of the freedom to choose where we are going and how we want to get there — the freedom to define our own path as human beings. But freedom, like much of what defines us, depends on how others see us and, most of all, on how we see ourselves. The people’s choice of freedom and the respect of the powerful for that freedom are therefore both essential requirements in that regard.
I come from a people who for a long time saw themselves as less than others, who never had the courage to make their own decisions, and whose destiny was always controlled by others. The land of my people is the smallest country on the American continent, yet even countries with far more territory, money and power than us do not respect our dominion over that
little piece of land. They are the rightful masters of their own countries, but they are incorrect to think that they are also the masters of ours. The fact is that there is a group of powerful countries that not only have much more than everyone else, but also believe they are entitled to the little that we, the countries without power, have.
We can compare that scenario to someone living in a very small and humble house, but who has a very wealthy neighbour, whose house is a beautiful and gigantic palace, with vast expanses of land and unimaginable treasures. The person living in the little house respects and admires her neighbour and does not mind that he is immensely richer than she. She is happy in her little house but decides to make improvements to it, paint it, fix it up and give it better furnishings — quite an undertaking, no doubt, but she is sure it will be worth it.
Everything is going well, until the rich neighbour decides that his poor neighbour does not have the right to fix her house, buy new furniture or paint the walls. The rich neighbour decides that in addition to owning his own palace, he can also order around the person in the little house. He orders, without her permission, that everything in the house remain lousy as it was before.
On the surface, the poor neighbour has no reason to despise or envy her rich neighbour or to aspire to what he has. She has no reason to plan to go to his palace and order him around or demand that he change his marble floors. But the poor neighbour should at least have the right to clean her own house, repair and paint her own walls, change her own furniture, plant flowers in her own garden and redo her own roof so it is free of leaks and protects her from the rain. That should not bother the rich neighbour. He should not be ordering her to put her old furniture back, cut her flowers, strip the walls, remove the new roof, which is functioning fine, and put back the old roof — which is all the more aggravating because the leaky roof never worked in the first place.
The rich neighbour has no authority to order his poor neighbour to return to the past, first, because he has no claim to be in charge of another person’s house; secondly, because the poor neighbour had tried previously to follow her rich neighbour’s orders and the consequences could not have been worse; and thirdly, because the improvements she made in the first place were actually working. Why should her neighbour force her to go back to the way she was before? For what purpose? To what end? Should he not be happy that his poor neighbour is a little better off than before?
That is why I say that freedom is something we are still fighting for in El Salvador. Because although we are free, sovereign and independent on paper, we will not be truly so until the powerful understand that we want to be their friends, that we admire and respect them and that our doors are wide open to trade and tourism so that we can build the best possible relations. But what they cannot do is to come and boss us around — not only because the land is ours, but also because it would not make sense to undo what we are achieving.
In a very short time, El Salvador has gone from being virtually the most dangerous country in the world — literally, the most dangerous country in the world — to being on its way to being the safest country in America. We went from being a country that was unknown to many — while the few who knew it, knew it for its gangs, deaths, violence and war — to being a country known for its beaches, surfing, volcanoes, financial freedom and good governance and for having put an end to organized crime. Those achievements, which we have only just begun and have been obtained in a very short time, are immense for us. And we have the right to continue on the path of our development.
That is why I initially said that freedom is something we are still fighting for — because our rights to freedom and genuine independence still need to be recognized. I wanted to say these words from the rostrum today because maybe they will resonate not only in my country, El Salvador, but also for the other peoples of the world who, like mine, want the freedom to build their own path.
Some will be able to do it sooner and others later. For some it will be easier and for others more difficult. But it will happen much quicker if the powerful countries help us. And if they do not want to help us, they should at least stay out of the way. All peoples should find their own path, and in doing so they will find friends. To those countries, I humbly offer the friendship of my small country, the smallest on the American continent, the country of surfing, volcanoes and pupusas — a country that is still fighting for its freedom but is about to secure it.
Three years ago, I spoke here at the United Nations from this very this rostrum (see A/74/PV.7). At that time, I said that this format was already obsolete. Now, three years later, we can see that it has become even more so, but perhaps it still serves a purpose. Perhaps it will serve, among many other things, for me, the
representative of that small country — the smallest on the American continent — to humbly recall that the United Nations was not established to divide, destroy or subdue us, but so that we could relate to one another, work together, build a better community of countries and seek solutions to the problems of the world — but with absolute respect for the sovereignty and self- determination of every country and in the manner set out in the Charter of the United Nations itself, the first principle of which states that the Organization is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members. One of the main founding purposes of the United Nations is to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples.
Perhaps the transition from a unipolar world system to a multipolar one, a frequent topic of discussion, would be smoother if instead of moving from one super-Power to several super-Powers, we transitioned to a world in which all peoples were truly free to build their own path and our community of nations — all of us, big and small — would contribute our own experience and capabilities to solving humankind’s problems. No one could be against that, but as with freedom, it is easier said than done.
I came all the way here to speak from this rostrum in a format I no longer believe in, to say something that most likely will not change the way powerful countries see others anyway. But perhaps it will change the way that we, as developing countries, see ourselves. If after these short words I have achieved that, at least with a handful of individuals who will go on to see themselves with respect and understand that they are capable of building their own path, then it was worth coming all this way to speak in this obsolete format. And who knows what will happen? Perhaps, in time, other nations — other peoples — will emerge who also decide to fight for their freedom. Then the United Nations will have become relevant again, at least for a humble servant like me. May God bless all the nations of the world."
Estonia,EST,Europe,"  1,323,000 ",26173,5.760000229,6.1,78.567,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,197,14.89,"  1,323,000 ",100.00,11.72,"It is my honour to be here today, although I wish that the circumstances surrounding my first address were different. A year ago, the Secretary- General presented his inspiring report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), which outlines his vision for the next 25 years of global cooperation, and initiated discussions on how to reinvigorate multilateralism and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
I support the goals of the report, and yet it is a Herculean task because the world is torn apart. We are witnessing the constant brutal violation of the core principles of the Charter of the United Nations on every continent. The United Nations itself has become a battlefield, where some States try to convince the world that the common values to which we all are obliged to adhere do not exist.
The only standard that we must follow is the United Nations Charter — our unique common promise of peace for all nations, large and small, and a promise to advance fundamental human rights and the equal rights of men and women. It is not a choice; it is a collective responsibility to ensure that peace, justice and human rights prevail.
On 24 February, the Russian Federation, a permanent member of the Security Council, attacked democratic and peaceful sovereign Ukraine. Russia started a war of aggression with the goal of ending the sovereignty of its neighbour, overthrowing its legitimate Government, exterminating the Ukrainian nation and implementing its abusive order, steeped in imperialism, self-interest and dominance.
The Russian invasion, including the illegal occupation of Crimea and Russia's prior land grabs in Georgia and Moldova, demonstrate Russia's total disrespect for international law and the rules-based international order and are an assault on the United Nations Charter and every value and principle for which the United Nations stands.
That brutal and unjustified aggression is the most serious threat to global peace and security since the end of the Second World War and challenges the very foundation of the United Nations system, undermining the security of all members of the international community.
Some colleagues are hesitant to take sides regarding the Russian aggression. Some argue that the war is between Russia and Ukraine. I see the aggressor and the victim. Legally, as well as morally, there is only one right side to take. Standing in a grey zone encourages the aggressor, undermines this Organization and fuels human suffering.
In recent years, we have witnessed devastating human suffering in Afghanistan, Myanmar, Yemen, Syria, the Sahel and the Horn of Africa, to name just a few places. Russia’s war of aggression makes finding solutions to those conflicts only more difficult, as it has increased food insecurity, adds pressure on the global humanitarian relief system and exacerbates the economic crisis.
I visited Ukraine two months after the invasion began. The site was horrific. I lack words to describe the brutality of that scene. The face of war is the same everywhere. Its cruelty will never leave the people who must live through it. Wars and conflicts bring only horror and misery to humankind.
As of 22 August, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights recorded over 13,000 civilian casualties in Ukraine, with approximately 6,000 people killed and nearly 8,000 injured. The actual numbers are significantly higher. Each murder is further proof of the grave violations of international law by the aggressor.
We condemn in the strongest terms the war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine. The Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights reported to the Security Council regarding credible allegations of forced transfers of unaccompanied children to Russian- occupied territory or to the Russian Federation (see S/PV.9126). We saw mass graves of tortured civilians. I wonder if we are living in the twenty-first century.
I want to pay tribute to the immeasurable resilience of the people of Ukraine. We grieve for the victims of Russia’s aggression, and we stand with Ukraine in ensuring a future for its people and nation.
That brave nation is fighting for values set out in the United Nations Charter — the noble cause of freedom, democracy and human rights. In accordance with Article 51 of the Charter, helping Ukraine to protect its right to exist is our collective obligation.
At the same time, it is disturbing that the Security Council, the organ that bears the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security, has been paralysed and utterly unable to play its role.
Russia has abused its veto power to block the Security Council from adopting any resolutions regarding the grave violation of the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine. The Security Council lies at the heart of the United Nations. It is shameful that, since 24 February, it has adopted only a presidential statement (S/PRST/2022/3) on Ukraine. How many devastating wars will it take to move forward the long- overdue Security Council reform?
I am grateful that, while the Security Council remains paralysed on the issue of Russia’s aggression, the soul and the conscience of the United Nations, the General Assembly, has been active and decisive. I recall the overwhelming support for resolution ES-11/1, adopted on 2 March, which condemns Russia’s aggression and urges Russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw all its troops from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.
We deplore the Russian Federation’s failure to implement that resolution, as well as its failure to comply with the legally binding order of the International Court of Justice of 16 March, requiring Russia to immediately cease its use of force against Ukraine.
Estonia has always been a strong proponent of curbing the absolute veto power, and even more so when it was used to cover up war crimes and crimes against humanity.
I am glad that the General Assembly adopted by consensus the landmark resolution 76/262, the so- called veto initiative, which provides the General Assembly an opportunity to step in when the Security Council is unable to act. The question remains: how can we accept that the aggressor has a veto power in the Security Council?
Conflicts and war bring about an enormous humanitarian crisis. Russia’s aggression has led to an immense need for resources and aid. Nearly 18 million Ukrainians — 40 per cent of the country’s population — are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. The international support for Ukraine has been heart-warming.
The United Nations is busy helping Ukrainians who did not need our help before that aggression. To date, Estonia has sent more than €20 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine. We have seen unprecedented, massive support for Ukraine from the Estonian private sector, civil society and citizens. We continue to assist, and work on, the reconstruction of Ukraine; it needs to begin now. We call on others to join us in that.
Conflicts created the immense refugee crisis. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the total number of people worldwide who were forced to flee their homes due to conflicts and human rights violations was 89.3 million in 2021. The displacements were driven, for example, by the brutality of the Bashar Al-Assad regime, conflicts in the Tigray region and the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul. In 2022, that number has already exceeded the milestone of 100 million. The increase is caused by Russia's war of aggression.
There are more than 7 million recorded Ukrainian refugees across Europe; another 7 million people were internally displaced. Estonia received nearly 55,000 refugees, which is 4 per cent of our country’s population. We ensure social services and basic
education for refugees fleeing from war. Estonia created 1,000 additional places in various education programmes for Ukrainian refugee children by opening a new school — the Freedom School. One day, its students will be the leaders and rebuilders of Ukraine. Estonian education technology companies are donating their solutions to support Ukrainian schools and pupils whose education has been disrupted by war.
Why am I saying all this? I am saying it because our future depends on young people sitting in classrooms and on their education. We are made by history; we cannot let a lack of knowledge define our future. To avoid such brutality repeating itself we must raise awareness of the history of our nations. We need to evade confusion caused by active brainwashing and disinformation. We see how ignorance makes it easy for any aggressor to put forward its false narratives.
War, conflict and a lack of openness bring about extreme violations of human rights. It must be clear that basic human rights are universal, are the same for all United Nations Members and cannot be ignored by any Government. Special attention should be devoted to ensuring gender equality and the right to education. The opportunity to study should not be a wish or a dream in the twenty-first century.
Let me use this rostrum to praise the courageous women who are now at the forefront of the protest against the Taliban in Afghanistan to fight for their right to choose their own path and role in society. It is our profound duty to support their struggle. I call on the de facto leaders of Afghanistan to immediately stop harassing the Afghan female staff of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. Respecting universal human rights is not a choice. Neither culture nor religion can be invoked to justify human rights violations.
In the same vein, we welcome the release of the assessment report on the human rights situation in Xinjiang by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The report underscores the serious human rights violations occurring in Xinjiang, which may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity. That is extremely alarming, and it requires urgent attention by the international community.
There remains little dispute over the existential crisis posed by climate change. We witnessed devastating flooding in Pakistan caused by erratic monsoon rains.
In solidarity with the people of Pakistan, Estonia is providing help to those who are severely affected. Russia’s aggression also brings further pain to those already suffering from the impacts of the pandemic, conflicts, famine and climate change.
Let me be very clear: that aggression has brought about high inflation and global food and energy crises. The head of the World Food Programme has warned that Russia’s aggression will lead to the worst food crisis since the Second World War. In physics and in life, the cause triggers a reaction. Russia’s aggression triggered the global food and inflation crisis. We have witnessed Russia’s occupying forces stealing Ukraine’s grain supplies, burning down warehouses and destroying grain fields.
Market disruptions are not caused by sanctions. The global food and economic crises are being caused by the war that Russia started, and Russia can end all that by ending the war. Yet Russia has no intention of ending the war. Instead, the Russian regime decided to escalate it. We find its cynical nuclear threat totally unacceptable; it is a threat to the global community.
To alleviate the crisis, the European Union (EU) launched the EU-Ukraine solidarity lanes initiative, which has helped to export more than 6 million tonnes of predominantly agricultural goods from Ukraine. Estonia also welcomes the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which, brokered by the Secretary-General and the President of Tiirkiye, was signed in Istanbul on 22 July. We must keep up the international pressure on Russia to monitor Russia’s adherence to the deal and its extension.
We are following with deep concern the situation at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, one of the world’s largest such plants. Russia has occupied the plant and turned it into a combat zone. The risk of a nuclear disaster is very real. The power plant should be demilitarized without delay and full control of the plant returned to Ukraine.
Moreover, it is essential to grant international experts ongoing and unfettered access to the facilities of the power plant. I regret that last month Russia also shamelessly blocked the consensus on the outcome document of the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
Estonia has been vocal in addressing the issues of cybersecurity at the United Nations. We continue such efforts to elevate cybersecurity as an essential component of the United Nations international peace and security agenda. Russia has demonstrated how State-provided malicious cybertools are used alongside conventional weapons. Russia’s cyberattack against Ukraine’s satellite communications on 23 February served to prepare and facilitate Russia’s invasion on the ground.
It is our duty to ensure accountability and justice at all levels. Impunity breeds impunity and leads to new crimes being committed. It is of the utmost importance that there be independent and effective investigations into the atrocity crimes and crimes of aggression committed against Ukraine, as well as in Syria, Ethiopia and elsewhere. We must provide justice to victims and bring those responsible for atrocities and genocide to trial.
Estonia fully supports the investigation led by the International Criminal Court. We give the most serious consideration to the establishment of an independent special court for crimes of aggression and a compensation mechanism for the damage caused by the aggression. We support all initiatives that seek to ensure accountability.
In conclusion, the war in Ukraine affects us all. It is our common duty to push back the ugly manifestations of imperialism, colonialism and racism by Russia. Russia must understand that the path that it has taken is disastrous and that the war that it started cannot be won. If we stop caring and if we get tired and fall into indifference, the aggressors and criminals will only be empowered. That is not the world where we want to live nor the world that we want to leave to future generations.
The United Nations is, and remains, the cornerstone of our multilateral rules-based world order. Its relevance is being put to the test; we cannot fail. The United Nations must emerge from this watershed moment stronger, more united and more relevant than ever before."
Eswatini,SWZ,Africa,"  1,136,000 ",7641,26.39599991,4.2,59.401,HIV/AIDS,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,338,29.75,"  905,738 ",79.73,4.53,"It is a great honour for me to address this seventy-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly, where we have once again come together as a community of nations to renew our commitment to implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals.
We are meeting at a time when we have just passed through a period of tragedy brought about by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has claimed lives all over the world. We thank God that this period is subsiding. We must praise the countries of the world for uniting to fight the pandemic up to this point, where it is on the verge of being eradicated. The development and supply of COVID-19 vaccines has proved very useful, especially with regard to prevention interventions. We also applaud the United Nations for being instrumental while working under extremely difficult conditions. It remained resolute in assisting countries, and it is safe to say we are where we are today because of its efforts. Despite those challenges, it is encouraging to think that there have been some positives to take away from that experience. In the case of Eswatini, we were compelled to develop testing laboratories and oxygen storage facilities, which are now very helpful in the fight against other health issues. We have witnessed the importance of the availability of oxygen, which has been used in saving the lives of snakebite victims and in other medical emergencies.
The COVID-19 pandemic arrived in the midst of an HIV/AIDS pandemic, which we are still battling, and it affected various programmes that had been put in place. Eswatini has made great strides in the fight against HIV and AIDS. We became a shining example for the continent and the world at large after we attained the 95-95-95 UNAIDS treatment-cascade targets in 2020. We are now focused on ending the AIDS pandemic as a global health threat by 2030. That milestone would never have been possible without the support of the development partners that have been with the country since 1986 when our first AIDS case was announced.
It is unfortunate that even after COVID-19, when we were beginning to say that there was hope, we are now confronted with the conflicts that are going on all over the world. Their consequences include, among other things, a loss of life. Those conflicts and tensions have also contributed significantly to the rise in food prices globally. They are not unique to specific areas, as they persist in Africa, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. We hope to see an end to those clashes through peaceful settlements, and we must applaud the United Nations for its efforts to prevent them from escalating. Hopefully, there will be long-lasting and fruitful results emerging from the interventions of the United Nations. As we gather here in this Hall, we are all reminded of the main purpose of the Organization’s establishment, which was to reduce the tensions that lead to conflict around the world. We hope the aspirations of our forefathers will guide us in using the Organization to bring us together, so that we can resolve our differences where they exist and find lasting solutions. That will unquestionably be of great help to all humankind.
Those problems are a setback to the ongoing efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), given the negative impact of COVID-19 and the fact that various conflicts are also taking their own toll on those programmes. During the pandemic we witnessed the collapse of many economies, industry shutdowns and disrupted poverty alleviation projects that could not be implemented properly owing to the pandemic prevention measures. That meant that there was no movement of people or goods. Nevertheless, now that COVID-19 is subsiding, it is high time for all of us to once again renew our focus on the SDGs and implement them, as they will play a crucial role in helping our countries develop.
We also note the importance of the role that will have to be played by financial institutions in assisting countries in the recovery process, as most countries suffered a great deal, economically and financially, and are therefore now facing challenges in raising the resources to fund that recovery. We urge our financial institutions to remain open to receiving countries that need support for reviving their developmental programmes and to welcome their requests with sympathy for their plight in the face of the challenges they have encountered in dealing with COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS. We do appreciate that in recent days we have seen the multilateral financial organizations become more welcoming to countries in need of budgetary
support. We trust that the world will continue to come together to contribute to resolving those challenges, as countries are dealing with great strains on their resources, which they will feel for some time to come.
Our theme for the Assembly at its seventy-seventh session is “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”. It fits very well with many of the issues we are facing in the world today. The Kingdom of Eswatini, like all other Member States, has not been immune to encounters that have heightened the pressure on our already stressed economies. They have derailed us from our pursuit of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union Aspirations for 2063 — the Africa We Want. The theme should therefore serve to kick-start our economies towards recovery and enable us to create a sustainable future for our people. We in Eswatini are continuing our efforts to attract investment and support small and medium enterprises, as well as to create big industries. In doing so, we are aware of the need for reliable energy sources to help us achieve our investment goals, so that is one of the areas that we are working on developing as a region. We are also focused on remaining highly competitive, which is why we are ranked at the top of the World Bank’s ease of doing business index in Africa when it comes to trading across borders.
The Government has also put in place fiscal support measures to ensure that the costs of establishing businesses and their initial operating costs are drastically reduced through a range of options from fiscal to non-fiscal incentives. The creation of special economic zones has put us at an advantage to leverage our export potential through attracting export-oriented manufacturing projects. Eswatini is also well positioned as a launching pad to the African Continental Free Trade Area which seeks to boost intra-Africa trade with a market of 1.2 billion people and a combined gross domestic product of $2.2 trillion.
The country is also engaged in creating opportunities for our youth to address the issue of unemployment and poverty. There are opportunities to be explored in areas of information and communications technology, agriculture and the informal sector, to name but a few. The Kingdom of Eswatini welcomes the new programme by the United Nations Development Programme to support our youth in Africa who want to engage in entrepreneurship to mitigate the issues of poverty. This is a noble idea, and we are ready to embrace it.
Food security and ending hunger remain a priority for the Government of the Kingdom of Eswatini. We are deploying a double-pronged strategy to address this challenge by providing social safety nets for the most vulnerable groups. We have increased budget allocations, engaged in emergency food aid distribution, provided cash transfers to the elderly and vulnerable, and supported school feeding programmes and other support services for disadvantaged populations.
With regard to growth and development in agriculture, the key projects driven by these public investments include the acceleration of water harvesting and irrigation development, where an average of 1,000 hectares is developed with irrigation every year. We are also creating market-linked growth opportunities in agriculture for small and emerging farmers to produce and generate income to enhance their livelihoods.
The negative effects of climate change are compelling the Government to build more dams throughout the Kingdom for irrigation. Other initiatives include the rollout of input subsidies for staple food crops. The combination of these programmes has also increased the production of maize, our staple food, by 30 per cent for the 2021-2022 farming season, only 9 per cent short of our national target.
With global stability at stake, Africans have recognized the need to guard against opportunists who seek to take advantage of fragile economies to advance their agendas. Ours is a history littered with problems of the past and ongoing attempts to reinfiltrate our countries through covert and overt means. Eswatini is of the ardent belief that Africa must have permanent representation in the United Nations Security Council, a call made in the Ezulwini Consensus in 2005. Our position emanates from the fact that every democracy has its particularity and that societies are founded according to different cultural norms and values. We will not tire of the consideration and belated adoption of this call by the United Nations to bring in a proper perspective on the African polity.
It must be noted that, when the world faced the COVID-19 pandemic, no country was spared, which means we all needed to come together to find solutions. Unfortunately, Taiwan was unable to access some of the World Health Organization’s programmes and thereby implement the remedies that required their approval.
We continue to appeal for Taiwan to be considered for full participation in United Nations agencies. We are confident that the global village would benefit substantially from Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the United Nations system. The Kingdom of Eswatini calls upon the United Nations to make the necessary arrangements for Taiwan to significantly participate in relevant United Nations specialized agencies and mechanisms.
As I conclude, Eswatini remains confident in this global body’s ability to confront and overcome the challenges we face because most of them are human- made. We can achieve this through our full commitment to the ideals of the United Nations Charter. At this time, history is calling on each State Member of the United Nations to intensify its efforts to address our plight if we envisage triumphantly walking the path to 2030.
However, and most importantly, we must remain certain about one crucial thing: our success hinges on unity and respect for one another. Those are the key to all outcomes of this seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly. Despite our diversity, we are one big happy family. We need to give the world and our peoples hope and confidence that the United Nations has the full mandate to play its role in all global issues that affect humankind. May the Almighty God bless us all."
Ethiopia,ETH,Africa,"  109,224,000 ",1659,5.203999996,4.4,66.24,Neonatal Disorder,Cardiovascular Disease,Diarrheal Disease,6030,5.52,"  55,806,892 ",51.09,4.35,"I congratulate the President, as well as his country, Hungary, on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session. I would also like to thank His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid for his service and leadership during the seventy-sixth session of the General Assembly. I have the greatest honour to address the Assembly on behalf of my country, Ethiopia.
We are at a historic crossroads in the evolution of our multilateral system. Humankind is facing multiple and complex challenges, ranging from climate change, extreme poverty, conflicts, terrorism and geopolitical tensions. The consequences of those global challenges are of epic proportions and leave adverse sociopolitical impacts across the world. Nevertheless, international
cooperation is not nearly at a level that is commensurate with the gravity of the challenges.
Although climate change and the resulting extreme weather conditions occur throughout the globe, the crisis largely affects the minimally resilient and those least responsible for causing the problem. A case in point is our region, the Horn of Africa, which is badly hit by record-level drought in some parts, while sustaining extreme flooding in other parts.
Climate disaster and its insufferable impacts are preventable. I therefore make an urgent call to all States gathered here to translate rhetoric into action. We must realize our climate financing commitments in order to build resilience and mitigate the impacts. We should act to meet our emission-reduction targets. That requires focused coordination, non-politicization, the avoidance of securitization and good-faith cooperation among all stakeholders.
I must emphasize that Africa is not responsible for the historic emissions that caused the climate crisis; yet we are the ones making the most tangible contribution to mitigate the impacts of climate change. In Ethiopia, our afforestation programme, the Ethiopian Green Legacy Initiative, saw the planting of billions of seedlings and created a strong culture of afforestation. We are also on a path to sustainable energy transformation and green growth. These proactive programmes deserve recognition and tangible support.
We have a shared planet and a common destiny. Overcoming our collective challenges requires concerted effort and trusted global leadership. We are gathered in this Hall because our forefathers, learning from the tragic episodes of human history, decided to establish the United Nations as the guardian of peace. However, we have yet to achieve true universality in the main organs of the United Nations. Africa has no permanent seat at the Security Council, and our quest for African solutions to African problems has yet to be given the respect and support it deserves. We believe that these considerations underpin the credibility of the Council on the continent.
African problems are sustainably addressed when approached in the true context of the region and when full account is taken of the strategic interests and aspirations of the countries concerned. It is only when we do this and uphold regional solutions that we will be able to start reducing the proliferation and seemingly unending presence of African issues on the Security Council’s agenda.
Over the past four years, Ethiopia has made significant progress in its socioeconomic development and democratization. At the same time, these years have brought forth challenges that have tested our survival as a nation. In November 2020, a most heinous and treasonous attack was made against the Ethiopian National Defence Forces, which had endeavoured not only to protect the peace and stability of Ethiopia but also to help keep peace in other countries, on behalf of the United Nations and the African Union (AU).
The criminal group that remains hell-bent on destroying the societal foundation of our country colluded with external actors opposed to our development aspirations. The insecurity this group created has been very tragic and costly. Although the Government of Ethiopia earnestly tried to avoid this conflict, our efforts to prevent it from being ignited were regrettably unsuccessful.
Thanks to the resolve and determination of Ethiopians, the designs of the adversaries against Ethiopia’s progress have been frustrated. We have also paved a path for peace and recovery, relying on the ability of the peace-loving people of Ethiopia to reconcile, make peace among ourselves and start the process of healing. We therefore call for support for our agenda for peace, reconciliation and reconstruction. We also urge respect and support for the AU-led peace process. Any other approach, including the politicization of human rights and unilateral coercive measures, will not yield a positive outcome.
The past year has also been a milestone for my country and, we believe, for the entire Nile River basin. Our project, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, commenced lighting our homes and fulfilling our intergenerational aspirations. All the glory and gratitude go to the people of Ethiopia, who financed this project. The dividend goes far and wide to the entire region. Taking this opportunity to do so, I reiterate Ethiopia’s commitment to equity and cooperation in the use of transboundary rivers to bring about shared prosperity with all riparian countries. We will continue the trilateral negotiation under the auspices of the African Union in good faith so as to reach a mutually acceptable outcome.
Over the past three years, the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has
encountered serious setbacks. The global coronavirus disease pandemic has tested our health systems. Global trade in goods and services was halted causing great losses in our economies. The response by international financial institutions has been beneath the level required and did not account for the special vulnerability of least developed countries.
As the Secretary-General put it, it is necessary to turbocharge the implementation of the SDGs. We call for enhanced focus on and support for national efforts aimed at improving agricultural and manufacturing productivity, increasing investment, facilitating technology transfer, fostering fair trade, redoubling debt cancellation and restructuring, and enhancing international finance for national priority projects. Furthermore, we should enhance efforts to combat illicit financial flows, unlawful extraction of and trade in minerals, and corruption.
Africa’s young population and its vast natural resources should be a source of growth and better jobs. Africa can be the showcase for green and sustainable development. It can feed and power itself and the world. However, that requires reform of the global financial architecture to ensure more equitable, speedy and collaborative cooperation, based on the needs and potential of the least developed countries. More importantly, we must actively support Governments that work to create an environment conducive to the prosperity of their countries. In addition, Africa’s effort to chart its destiny must not be complicated by competition among Great Powers.
Allow me to conclude by re-emphasizing the need to scale up international cooperation. The gravity of the challenges we face today demands that we come together in search of collective solutions. We need more, not less, multilateralism. We shall continue to uphold our cardinal principles of independence, impartiality, integrity, non-interference, sovereign equality and non-selectivity to maintain a working multilateral system rooted in the Charter of the United Nations.
We need to reform our global institutions to reflect current realities. We need to make them more representative and responsive to the demands of our times. Only through genuine solidarity and concerted action can we ensure collective security and prosperity.
I am grateful for this opportunity to address the General Assembly and wish the President every success in this session."
Finland,FIN,Europe,"  5,523,000 ",38335,8.640000343,7.9,81.736,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,846,15.32,"  5,523,000 ",100.00,11.74,"I would like to start by congratulating Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy- seventh session. I also want to thank Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his determined and skilful leadership of the United Nations. They can both count on Finland’s steadfast support for their important work during these exceptional times.
As the theme of this session states, the challenges we are facing are intertwined. Russia is waging a
brutal war in Ukraine. The ripple effects of that war are already far-reaching and severe. They are compounding the pre-existing problems faced by the international community. A triple crisis concerning energy, food security and finance is weighing heavily on vulnerable countries, countries that are already suffering the most from the climate crisis and the coronavirus disease pandemic.
This truly is a watershed moment. As we gather here, we have an important opportunity to engage in dialogue, to find solutions and to understand the concerns of those most in need. As difficult as it may seem, now is the time to show global solidarity and strengthen multilateral cooperation. The international community can and should emerge stronger from these crises.
Russia’s cruel and unprovoked war on Ukraine has now been raging for seven months. It has brought immense sorrow and destruction to the sovereign lands of Ukraine. Russia’s use of force is in blatant violation of the Charter of the United Nations. It is an act of aggression, as determined by this very Assembly. Ukraine is exercising its inherent right to self-defence and, judging by the recent reports from the battlefields, it is doing so with admirable courage, strength and efficiency.
We, the international community, members of the General Assembly, might not always see eye to eye. We have our differing views, but it is our common obligation to uphold the international rules-based order. We cannot accept, condone or normalize grave violations of international law and human rights. A world where impunity prevails is unjust, unstable and dangerous for all of us.
There was a global food crisis even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. More than 800 million people in the world were chronically hungry. The war has further worsened this calamity. I would like to commend the Secretary-General and the President of Tiirkiye for their tireless efforts to reach an agreement to secure Ukrainian grain transports. If implemented as foreseen, it will have a major impact on the lives of tens of millions of people in need.
In order to respond to the wider challenges of global food security, we need collective action. The goal must be sustainable, inclusive and fair food systems. We also have to accelerate the implementation of other Sustainable Development Goals. We cannot afford to leave anyone behind.
Last year in this Hall, I noted that it is not an exaggeration to say that we are facing a global climate emergency (A/76/PV.4). This summer has proven it. We have seen extreme drought and heat waves across the globe, from the Horn of Africa to Europe, from China to the United States of America. The magnitude of the catastrophe caused by the floods in Pakistan is not yet fully visible, but the destruction is already tremendous.
Those are not isolated or local events. They are another a reminder that climate change is an existential threat to humankind. We are on the verge of very dangerous tipping points. That calls for urgent action on two fronts. First, we must change our course before it is too late. Secondly, we urgently need to help those suffering and support those with fewer resources to deal with this threat.
Besides mitigating climate change, we must adapt to it. In particular, we must honour the commitment of doubling adaptation finance made at the twenty- sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Glasgow. I want to underline this — fighting climate change and taking care of the economy are not contradictory. Green transition has a tremendous potential to create jobs, innovations and economic growth, but it has to be done fairly. The alarming loss of the variety of life on our planet should also be a cause for grave concern to all of us. We are on the brink of mass extinction, or perhaps are already there. Again, we need to change course urgently. We humans can thrive and survive only if we learn to coexist with all the other species. We need to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030. To that end, the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity in Montreal in December will be essential.
Defending human dignity is a fundamental task of the United Nations. It is up to us, the Member States, to live up to that task. Despite our failures, we also have accomplishments to build on. The Human Rights Council has shown determination. It has worked to ensure accountability for the horrendous acts committed against civilians in Ukraine and Syria. It has raised its voice in support of women and girls in Afghanistan.
I want to thank those who supported Finland’s membership of the Human Rights Council. As a member, Finland acts to bring justice to the victims
of human rights violations. Finland remains a staunch supporter of the work of the International Criminal Court in investigating all grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.
The number of conflicts in the world is the highest since the Second World War. One-quarter of humankind lives in conflict-affected countries. We must not ignore or forget Afghanistan, Myanmar, Syria, Yemen and other countries where human rights or the conditions for living a decent life are under threat. Increasing geopolitical tensions, as well as the impacts of climate change and the pandemic, are making conflicts more complex and prolonged. Ordinary people bear the brunt. For the first time in its history, the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Index has declined for two consecutive years. We simply cannot let that continue.
In this turbulent world, those who stoke the flames of conflict bear a special responsibility. But we all must ask ourselves: Have we done all we can to avert violence? Have we done what we can to make a positive change? Difficult times call for more diplomacy, not less. We must build and strengthen peace and prevent conflict wherever possible. That is the very core of the United Nations. We also have to be able to respond to emerging threats to peace and security and to move from hindsight to foresight. The report of the Secretary- General on Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) provides us with a blueprint for more effective multilateralism, paving a way to solutions to current and future global problems and strengthening peace. It really is our common agenda, and Finland wholeheartedly supports its implementation.
In the current security environment, the international arms control architecture is increasingly challenged. On the one hand, political tensions erode the functioning of the existing architecture. On the other hand, new technologies create new risks. But we cannot let arms control fail. On the contrary, it needs to be strengthened. For decades, arms control has provided stability and predictability in great power relationships and international relations. To quote Dag Hammarskjold, “disarmament is never the result only of the political situation; it is also partly instrumental in creating the political situation”.
The two biggest nuclear-weapon States have a unique responsibility to advance nuclear arms control and disarmament. The others need to follow suit. It is in the interest of all of us that progress in nuclear arms control and disarmament continue beyond the New START Treaty. We call on the United States and the Russian Federation to continue their dialogue on strategic stability with a view to achieving further cuts in their nuclear arsenals.
The interlocking global challenges demonstrate that, more than ever, we need a renewed commitment to multilateralism, with the United Nations at its core. We must not become indifferent or apathetic in the face of these multiple crises. We must not get used to violations of international law and human rights. We must not close our eyes to the growing needs of the vulnerable. We must not sleepwalk into a climate and biodiversity catastrophe. Nor should we lose sight of hope. There is still time to act."

Let us never forget that debt. It serves the interests of all our countries and indicates the path to peace. It reminds us that there is no other legitimate or lasting centre of power than that where the nations come together to make decisions sovereignly. It tells us that the universality of our Organization serves no hegemony or geopolitical oligarchy. Yet, this legacy, our Organization, along with our choices as nations, are today facing a choice.
We have one simple choice to make today, and that is the choice between war and peace. On 24 February, Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council, fractured our collective security with an act of aggression, invasion and annexation. It deliberately violated the Charter of the United Nations and the principle of the sovereign equality of States. On 16 March, the International Court of Justice stated that Russia’s aggression was illegal and demanded that Russia withdraw. Russia decided, with that action, to pave the way for other wars of annexation, today in Europe, but perhaps tomorrow in Asia, Africa or Latin America.
We may say whatever we like today. I have heard a number of discussions and a number of statements. However, I am certain of one thing. Right now, as I speak, there are Russian troops in Ukraine and, to my knowledge, there are no Ukrainian troops in Russia. That is an irrefutable fact that we must all accept. The longer this war lasts, the more it threatens peace in Europe and peace in the world. It will lead us towards broader, enduring conflict, where everyone’s sovereignty and security will be determined solely by power struggles, the size of armies, the solidity of alliances and the intentions of armed groups and militias, and where those who see themselves as strong seek to subjugate those they consider to be weak, using all possible means.
What we have been witnessing since 24 February is a return to the age of imperialism and colonies. France refuses to accept that and will determinedly seek peace. In that regard, our position is clear, and it is in supporting this position that I have pursued dialogue with Russia — even before war broke out —throughout these past months. And I will continue to do so because that is how we will seek peace together. We are seeking peace through initiatives undertaken in the years and months prior to the conflict in order to avert it. We have been seeking peace since 24 February through the humanitarian, economic and military support that we
have provided the Ukrainian people to exercise their legitimate right to self-defence and safeguard their freedom. We have been seeking peace through our condemnation of the invasion of a sovereign State, the violation of the principles of our collective security, and the war crimes committed by Russia on Ukrainian soil, and through our rejection of impunity. The international justice system should establish the crimes and try the perpetrators. We are seeking peace, lastly, through our will to curb the geographic spread and intensity of the war. It is up to us in that regard to support the efforts of the International Atomic Energy Agency to prevent the war’s consequences for nuclear safety and security, as we will do in the future alongside Ukrainians whose sovereignty over their plants is not up for discussion. We managed to have an Agency mission visit the plant and draw up a report independently. Let us work together to prevent the risk of an accident that would have devastating consequences.
All of us here today know that peace can be restored only with an agreement that complies with international law. Negotiations will be possible only if, sovereignly, Ukraine wants them and Russia agrees to them in good faith. We all know too that negotiations will be successful only if Ukraine’s sovereignty is respected, its territory liberated and its security protected. Russia now needs to understand that it cannot impose its will through military means, even by cynically accompanying them with sham referendums in the territories that have been bombarded and now occupied. It is up to the members of the Security Council to state that loud and clear, and to the members of the Assembly to support us on this path to peace.
From this rostrum, I call on the States Members of the United Nations to take action to persuade Russia to renounce its choice of war, assess the cost for itself and all of us and end its aggression. It is not a question of taking sides between the East or the West or between the North or South. We are talking about the responsibility of all those who are committed to respect for the Charter and to our most precious good — peace — because beyond war, there is a risk of global division due to the direct and indirect consequences of the conflict.
I know that many here in the Assembly are harbouring a sense of injustice with regard to the dire energy, food and economic consequences of Russia’s war. I also know that some countries represented here have remained neutral with regard to this war. I want to say to tell them as clearly as possible today that those who wish to take up the cause of the non-aligned by refusing to express themselves clearly are mistaken and bear a historic responsibility. The cause of the non-aligned used to be a cause for peace. The cause of the non-aligned used to be on behalf of the sovereignty of States and for the territorial integrity of each of them. That is what the cause of the non-aligned used to be. Those who remain silent today, in spite of themselves — or secretly with a degree of complicity — further the cause of a new imperialism, of a modern cynicism that breaks up our international order, without which peace is not possible.
Russia is working to implant the idea today of a double standard, but the war in Ukraine should not be a conflict that leaves anyone feeling indifferent. It is close to Europeans who have chosen to support Ukraine without entering into war with Russia. It feels farther away for many States represented here, but we have all felt the direct consequences of it and we all have a role to play to end this war because we are all paying its price. Because of its very foundations, this war launched by Russia flouts the principles at the heart of our Organization. It flouts the principles of the only international order possible, the only order that can guarantee peace — respect for national sovereignty and the inviolability of borders.
In that regard, let us not conflate causes and consequences. Who here can defend the idea that the invasion of Ukraine does not warrant punishment? Who here could consider that, on the day on which something similar is done to them by a more powerful neighbour, the silence of the region and the world would be the best response? Who can support that? Who can believe that it would suffice for Russia to win this war so that we could move on to something else? Nobody. Contemporary imperialism is not European or Western. It takes the form of a territorial invasion backed by a globalized hybrid war that uses energy prices, food security, nuclear safety, access to information and movements of people as weapons to divide and destroy. That is how this war is undermining the sovereignty of us all.
France will therefore stand with the free peoples of the United Nations to address the consequences of the conflict and all the inequalities that it is exacerbating by challenging bloc geopolitics and exclusive alliances because, beyond the direct consequences of the war, the risk we are now facing is that of a new partitioning of the world. Some would have us believe that there is the
West on one side that will defend outmoded values to serve its interests, and that on the other side there is the rest of the world that has suffered so much and seeks to cooperate by supporting the war or by looking the other way. I object to that division for at least two reasons.
The first is a question of principle, as I mentioned earlier. Our Organization champions universal values. Let us not allow the mistaken idea to take hold that there is something regional or adaptable in the values of the Charter. Our Organization has universal values and the division in the face of the war in Ukraine is simple. Are members for or against the law of the strongest, non-respect for the territorial integrity of countries and national sovereignty? Are members for or against impunity? I cannot imagine any international order or lasting peace that is not based on respect for peoples and the principle of responsibility. Therefore, yes, our values are universal and that is why they can never serve a Power that violates these principles. And when we have taken liberties with these same values in recent years, we have been wrong to do so, but that cannot under any circumstances justify trampling on what we collectively built after the Second World War.
I hear Russia say that it is ready to work on new cooperation and a new international order, without hegemony. That is great, but on what principles is that new order based? Invading a neighbour? Not respecting borders of those I do not like? What is that order? Who is hegemonic today if not Russia? What is being proposed to us? What is being sold to us? What dream is being sold on the good faith of some of us here today? Nothing that lasts for long. Let us not give into the cynicism that is breaking up the order that we have built and that alone has enabled us to maintain international stability. These values — respect for national sovereignty, the integrity of borders — are our values. I reiterate that we were wrong every time we took liberties with them, but they are the values that we built after the Second World War, after colonialism. Let us refuse to have history falter under the pretext that today it is other geographic regions that are affected. Let us not give in.
The second reason I object to this attempt to partition the world is pragmatic. Behind the emerging divisions, there is an attempt to partition the world in a way that ramps up tension between the United States and China. I believe this is a disastrous mistake for us all because it would not be a new Cold War. Several powers of disorder and imbalance are taking advantage of this period to multiply regional conflicts, return to the path of nuclear proliferation and reduce collective security. I therefore believe that we must do everything we can to ensure that this new division does not happen because our challenges are growing in number and urgency and require new cooperation.
Let us look at Pakistan. A third of the country has been flooded. There are more than 1,400 dead, 1,300 injured and millions of people in emergency situations. Let us look at the Horn of Africa. It is experiencing the worst drought in 40 years and a rainy season that will probably be worse still. Half of humankind now lives in a climate danger zone. Our ecosystems are reaching the point of no return. Let us look at Somalia, Yemen, South Sudan and Afghanistan. Famine is returning. The food crisis is affecting everywhere, and the most vulnerable are hardest hit. Around the world, 345 million people, including 153 million children, are experiencing acute hunger. There are currently 55 civil wars being waged on our planet. There are 100 million displaced persons. While between 1990 and 2015, 137,000 people escaped extreme poverty every day, by 2030 some 345 million in conflict-affected countries could slip back into it.
The most vulnerable people are always the hardest hit by crises, climate disruption, pandemics and rising food prices. These threats are all still present, while in addition terrorism, among other areas, is affecting the Sahel and the Middle East. There is nuclear proliferation in Iran and North Korea, which we have not managed to curb. These are the emergencies facing us. As time is short, the description I have just given is not exhaustive, but these emergencies are each either the result of deep-rooted flaws in our international system, which was able to reap the benefits of globalization but failed to contain its divisions, threats and imbalances, or the result of divisions among us.
Our shared responsibility is to work to help the most vulnerable, those most affected by all these challenges. As Mr. Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India, rightly said, now is not the time for war. Nor is it time for revenge on the West, or for Western opposition to the rest of the world. It is time for sovereign, equal countries to work together on today’s challenges. That is why we must urgently create a new contract between North and South, an effective, respectful contract on food, climate and biodiversity, and education. The time for bloc thinking has passed. It is now time to build specific action coalitions and reconcile legitimate interests and the common good.
To address the global food crisis, France has doubled its contributions to the World Food Programme. Along with the European Union, we established solidarity corridors that enabled the export by land of more than 10 million tons of grain since spring. The agreement brokered on 22 July complemented those efforts, thanks to the work of the Secretary-General, which led to the export of 2.4 million tons of grain through the Black Sea, a process that is ongoing.
We launched the Food and Agricultural Resilience Mission initiative, which allows us to provide vulnerable countries with food at low prices, without political conditions, and to invest in agriculture in countries that would like to be self-sufficient. I would also like to announce that France will fund the export of Ukrainian wheat to Somalia, in partnership with the World Food Programme. We will do so with solidarity, efficiency and the required full transparency.
Tomorrow we will meet with the African Union, United Nations agencies, the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and the European Commission to develop a mechanism that can ensure access to fertilizer for Africa, in support of the Secretary-General’s initiatives in that regard.
With regard to climate and biodiversity, in a few weeks we will meet in Egypt for the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Let us be clear here about what a just transition means. Our first collective fight is to eliminate coal. The crisis must not make us lose sight of that goal. Otherwise, we will exceed the predictions of a 2°C global temperature increase. I am prepared to invest in funding coalitions, as we did with South Africa a few months ago. We must continue along that path. However, China and the large emerging Powers must make a clear decision at COP. It is crucial.
Together with the large emerging Powers, we must build coalitions with State actors and our international financial institutions to develop comprehensive energy production solutions and effect changes to industrial production models, which alone can bring about that transition.
The Group of Seven must lead by example. The richest countries must accelerate their carbon neutrality programmes and must also make the effort to show restraint and share green technologies. Members know that they can count on the European Union in that area.
I also believe that we must acknowledge that it is challenging for the poorest countries to take simultaneous steps to fight poverty and accelerate the transition. We cannot ask the same of both sub-Saharan Africa, where 100 million people remain without access to electricity, and the largest emitters. That is why the richest countries must strengthen their financial and technological solidarity with the poorest countries on climate issues. We must provide funding and solutions and accelerate that agenda, as we were able to do during the pandemic, and we must do in a more forceful, effective and determined manner. In that context, together we must also protect our carbon pricing and biodiversity. Together with Costa Rica, France will host the 2025 United Nations Ocean Conference. Let us make it the COP21 for oceans.
With regard to health, we must learn from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We must recognize that health systems and personnel are our first line of defence in the most vulnerable countries. I will underscore that crucial point during the seventh Replenishment Conference of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, to which France remains one of the principal contributors. We must also ensure that the World Health Organization establishes early-warning systems to prevent the spread of other viruses. We must address human and animal health together. That is the key objective of the One Health Initiative, led by France, in coordination with several other countries.
As with the Global Partnership for Education, we must continue our efforts so that children can attend school after the pandemic prevented them from doing so. It means addressing the root of the problem, combating all inequalities and working towards our common future.
As members can see, more cooperation and partnerships among stakeholders in the North and the South must be developed in all areas. Greater commitment is needed from our major institutions. All of that is the opposite of division. Who was there during the pandemic? Who proposed funding for the climate transition? It is not those who now propose a new international order but had no vaccines that worked. It is not those who did not show solidarity and contributed nothing to help mitigate climate issues. Those are the challenges that affect us all. We must demonstrate greater solidarity and engage in more cooperation, but
under no circumstances should we yield to siren calls that lead nowhere.
To that end, we must also be clear about the situation in the poorest countries and the middle-income countries — whether in Africa, South America, Asia or the Pacific. The pandemic has increased inequalities. The war and its consequences have increased the number of challenges for several countries. The Group of 20 (G-20) must therefore absolutely adhere to last year’s goal to mobilize $100 billion from special drawing rights, but we must do more, above all with respect to the IMF’s special drawing rights allocations.
We must honour our commitments. Several countries, in particular in Africa, have not yet seen that money. We cannot tell them that it is being held up by a Parliament or being prevented by some rule. That cannot happen. It will be too late. We must do more because the challenges are even greater. We must increase our special drawing rights allocation to 30 per cent for the most vulnerable African countries and the poorest countries in the world. Along with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, we must recommit our mechanisms, which are no longer adapted to the current context.
The rules in use today are those from the 1980s. The situation in our post-COVID-19 world — increased climate deregulation, the loss of biodiversity, imbalances created by the war — call for greater solidarity. We need a new financial compact with the South. That is where we must act. That is what should bring us together, not to fight a common enemy or to refute false narratives or historical revisionism, but to protect the planet on which we all live and for equal opportunities for all.
The fight is our fight. It brings us all together. We simply need to make a little more effort to adhere to our agreements and respect one another. This is the true fight. If we are not able to fight together, it will be the cause of all division and conflicts in the future.
I invite all those who wish to build that new compact with us to the Paris Peace Forum, which will be held on 11 November, ahead of the G-20 meeting to be held in Bali. I invite them to move forward with us without relinquishing our common values and guiding principles. We must focus on essential matters and not give in to the world’s divisions or increased threats to peace. We must not allow the number of crises, including those that cannot be resolved, to increase.
We cannot allow the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Those are all risks that we will not be able to manage in the future without involving the major Powers most directly concerned. It is precisely that effort to involve the major regional Powers that must be made in the Middle East, via a follow-up to the 2021 Baghdad conference, in order to ensure stability in Iraq, Lebanon and the entire region.
The five permanent members of the Security Council are no longer the only ones with something to say, and if they have something to say it is clear. That can work only if we are able to work more broadly to achieve the international consensus that is so necessary for peace. That is why I hope that we can commit at last to reform of the Security Council so that it is more representative, welcomes new permanent members and
remains able to fully play its role by restricting the use of the right to the veto in cases of mass atrocities.
Together, we must build peace and contemporary international order to achieve the goals of the Charter of the United Nations. On that path, the United Nations can count fully on France. On that path, each country represented here can count on France."
Gabon,GAB,Africa,"  2,119,000 ",14334,19.6590004,4.8,66.187,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Lower Respiratory Infection,183,8.64,"  1,940,401 ",91.57,6.02,"I warmly congratulate the President of the General Assembly on his election and wish him every success. I also pay tribute to and congratulate his predecessor, Mr. Abdullah Shahid, for his commitment during the seventy-sixth session. I reiterate my country’s full support to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as he serves our Organization.
I am delighted once again to speak in earnest, for the situation demands just that. Indeed, the international system is at a critical juncture as the world struggles to recover from a pandemic and remains in the clutches of a multidimensional crisis. The emergence of new centres of influence results in entrenched positions and demands that we prioritize ongoing dialogue, instead of power struggles, to reach global consensus in addressing controversial issues within the multilateral system.
In the light of the rivalry among Powers and the multifaceted challenges that affect us all, it would be dangerously naive to continue focusing on power struggles or unilateral positions. The interconnected nature of global issues and national economies compels us to engage in dialogue in order to respond appropriately and above all collectively to the most serious threats to international peace and security.
We are in the last quarter of a year of increasingly difficult global challenges that have thwarted common and individual efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. With fewer than eight years left until the deadline for reaching those goals, it is crucial that we assess our progress in the light of the ongoing threat posed by the coronavirus disease pandemic to our economies.
A threat just as insidious now looms over our economies: inflation. Around the world, it is reaching tragic record levels. No one is spared — neither businesses nor households, neither the North nor the South. Its effects are devastating. As such, we must take action. Of course, we must take individual action, which is precisely what Gabon is doing by subsidizing certain commodities and controlling the price of others. Nonetheless, it that regard too, we will be successful in overcoming that problem only if we take collective action in a coordinated manner and in solidarity with each other. It is yet another challenge the world must face. We must all meet that challenge together.
This year marks many new beginnings for Gabon, as we arise from the tragedy and forced inertia of the coronavirus disease pandemic and reopen to the world. We are the newest member of the Commonwealth of Nations, which is home to 2.5 billion people — one third of the world’s population — with shared values of respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law. My country is broadening the horizons of its citizens and seizing the chance for our young people to benefit by studying, travelling and building business relationships far beyond our own borders.
At the same time, Gabon takes its place on the world stage — not alone but as a proud African nation. However, the problems that our world faces today are global, as are the solutions. We must all be outward-facing, not inward-looking, as we confront the difficulties of a world in which resources are finite and populations are growing.
This month, our Commonwealth family lost its leader — Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Through the union that she loved so deeply, the Queen offered respect, friendship and wise counsel to many independent nations around the world, small or large. She promoted peace, liberty and shared values and fostered a spirit of cooperation.
As the new Head of the Commonwealth, His Majesty King Charles III can be assured of my full support and that of the Gabonese people. As a dear friend of Gabon for many years, King Charles III shares my enthusiasm for protecting our natural environment and biodiversity and my concerns about global climate and sustainability.
Fifty years after the Stockholm Conference, humankind faces an unprecedented triple environmental crisis — climate change, the biodiversity extinction crisis and pollution, notably by plastics.
First, with regard to climate change, thanks to its 88 per cent forest cover and a rate of deforestation well below 0.1 per cent, Gabon is an exemplary high- forest, low-deforestation country. Since the fifteenth Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was held in Copenhagen in 2009, Gabon has net absorbed more than 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide. We absorb more than 100 million tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year. In other words, we have already achieved and indeed have exceeded the Paris Agreement on Climate Change objective of carbon neutrality. We are counting on the creation of a net carbon sequestration market to enable us to maintain that performance through 2050 and beyond.
Secondly, I find the biodiversity crisis extremely alarming. The fifteenth COP to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, to be held in Montreal, will be a decisive moment for humankind, and it is critical that we adopt an ambitious global biodiversity framework. The time has come to transition from billions to trillions by mobilizing 1 per cent of global gross domestic product to benefit the natural environment.
Thirdly, pollution has become a chronic problem for our cities, rivers and oceans. We must waste no time in adopting a binding international agreement on plastic pollution, as well as a treaty of the high seas. To achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, our international agreements and national policies must address the interdependence of those crises.
Threats to international peace and security continue to increase exponentially. Faced with the proliferation of armed groups, restricting their access to arms will be at the heart of my country’s priorities during its presidency of the Security Council in October. In that regard, I would like to reiterate my country’s call for a robust partnership to ensure greater security in the Gulf of Guinea.
Many countries face humanitarian crises that are exacerbated by armed conflict. That is the case in Ukraine, where the war has led to a worsening of the situation in countries and regions that were already experiencing food shortages. That is why my country has clearly expressed its opposition not only to that bloody war but to any form of war. Gabon, which has never experienced armed conflict, will continue to advocate and favour dialogue and negotiation over confrontation.
Access to education for children should be considered sacred. Therefore, I would like to express my country’s resolute support for the sanctuarization of schools and places of education, particularly during armed conflicts. To compromise education is to place a mortgage on future generations. It is in that vein that I have made the promotion of women and young people a key priority. In 2015, I launched the Decade of the Gabonese Woman, which aims to reserve a place of choice for women and children in all aspects of governance in Gabon.
Internationalism is at a turning point. We need to reform the United Nations to ensure better consideration of the aspirations of Africa. That is particularly applicable to the Security Council, where Africa’s role needs to be consolidated. Africa has waited long enough, and we will not wait any longer.
In the light of the strong interdependence of nations, it is crucial that we put an end to the use of sanctions, while working instead to build bridges of prosperity. As such, I call once again for the total lifting of the embargo that has affected the Government and the people of Cuba for several decades. Inevitably, the principal victims of any embargo are the weak and the vulnerable.
In the Middle East, Gabon has always believed that the two-State solution is the only way to achieve peace and security. It is the responsibility of our generation to resolve that problem.
In conclusion, I would like to reiterate Gabon’s commitment to the principles and values of solidarity at the heart of the Charter of the United Nations. To that end, I reiterate my country’s solemn appeal to all members of the international community to live up to their shared commitments in order to ensure peace, security and dignity for the peoples of the world."
Gambia,GMB,Africa,"  2,280,000 ",1950,9.449999809,4.9,61.735,Cardiovascular Disease,Lower Respiratory Infection,Neonatal Disorder,113,4.96,"  1,419,826 ",62.27,5.38,"I bring warm greetings from the people of the Gambia and the wish that we will have a successful and fruitful seventy-seventh session.
It is regrettable that we could not convene a proper general summit over the past two years due to the outbreak of the coronavirus disease. Allow me, therefore, to pay a special tribute to the millions of people who have succumbed to the pandemic worldwide. In their memory, we must commit ourselves to better pandemic preparedness and response.
My delegation congratulates Mr. Csaba Korosi on his efficient role as President of the General Assembly and I assure him of the Gambia’s support during his tenure. We also felicitate the Secretary-General for ably steering the affairs of the United Nations during what has become one of the most challenging times of the century.
Numerous interlocking global challenges requiring coordinated global action make it most pressing for us to rise to the occasion. This makes the theme “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges” quite appropriate. In the thick of all the complexities confronting world leaders, we must underscore the centrality of the unique role and potential of the United Nations to make a huge difference in the lives of the people. Durable solutions that match the magnitude and intensity of the never- ending challenges remain the Assembly’s greatest challenge. The situation calls for new perceptions, new approaches, new partnerships, renewed commitments and increased resource levels equal to the scale of both current and emerging challenges. To recover as a global family, we must muster the requisite courage and political will and take advantage of the opportunities that go with the global crises.
The current cost-of-living crisis across the world is a wake-up call for an immediate global response to alleviate the suffering and poverty that hold our nations to ransom. The global inflationary trends, food insecurity and the energy crisis compound the natural disasters that continue to cause havoc around the world. The need for relief grows by the day, yet global efforts appear to be less and less effective. In that connection, my delegation fully welcomes the establishment of the Secretary-General’s Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance and eagerly looks forward to concrete, action-oriented recommendations and solutions. As one of the hard-hit developing countries, the Gambia stands ready to cooperate with the Group to find real solutions for immediate relief.
We have come to this summit with gratitude for the partnerships and support extended to us from 2016 to date. We thank the Secretary-General personally and the entire United Nations body for their continued support of our peacebuilding and reconciliation efforts. The Gambia has come a long way from dictatorship and has transitioned into a true multiparty democracy. Following the 2021 presidential election and the legislative elections this year, the consolidation process is gaining momentum. We will step up reforming and strengthening our national institutions to sustain a robust democracy where human rights and fundamental freedoms underpin our national policies, programmes and development efforts. As we prepare to end the current electoral cycle with the 2023 local Government elections, we are proud that the Gambia now has multiple political parties and vibrant civil society organizations, with a sharp rise in public participation in national affairs.
Amid the socioeconomic challenges that beset our nation, characterized by reduced tourism engagements, inflation, food and energy insecurity, and modest economic growth, we are developing a new National Development Plan 2022-2026, to succeed the current Plan. With this new Plan, we seek to advance the pursuit of our national priorities, including the Sustainable Development Goals and the African Union Agenda 2063. We therefore solicit the support of the United Nations system, as well as our friends and development partners. Our goal is to recover and grow our economy, transform digitally and consolidate our democratic gains. Our resolve is to uplift our people
from poverty, secure their livelihoods and create new avenues to transition into a prosperous, peaceful and stable nation. Because young people and women form the greater majority of our population, the Government will continue to empower them.
Like all other genuine nations, we are committed to the global consensus that no country should be left behind in this Decade of Action to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals. Despite its size and economic status, the Gambia is at the forefront of fighting climate change through ambitious national action plans, and we look forward to participating effectively in the twenty- seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Egypt and the fifth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries in Qatar.
Accelerating development in Africa hinges on addressing the underlying causes of insecurity and underdevelopment. As a continent, our collective goal is to have a peaceful Africa where the people enjoy the dividends of peace, stability and prosperity. African Governments are committed to silencing the guns on the continent as a strategic objective. For that reason, we ask the United Nations and the international community to shoulder their fair share of the burden of the African Union’s peace endeavours. Our experience with keeping the peace in Africa is marked by isolated efforts in many instances. Africa must be provided with adequate equipment and the means to fully play its peace-enforcement role on behalf of the international community.
As a long-standing troop- and police-contributing country, the Gambia will continue to support the Secretary-General’s Action for Peacekeeping initiative, and we welcome its reinforcement through the Action for Peacekeeping strategy. We are committed to improving the capacity of our officers through increased pre-deployment training, innovative partnerships and more gender-balanced peacekeeping deployment approaches. We must, however, review and do more to address the frequent deadly attacks against peacekeepers in mission areas by giving them realistic mandates. As a sitting member of the African Union Peace and Security Council, the Gambia’s commitment to peace and security in Africa and beyond remains unwavering.
We have ongoing conflicts on our continent that need urgent international attention. The complexity of the challenges in the Sahel dictates multipronged approaches and interventions that would ensure sustainable peace and stability. We must therefore reconsider our assumptions concerning that region and seek forward-looking solutions that empower the citizens. The current security and governance situation in Libya equally deserves a fresh thrust from the international community. We call on the contending parties on the ground to give the people a chance to live and coexist in peace.
Moroccan sovereignty and territorial rights over its Sahara region should be recognized by all. In that regard, the Government of the Gambia reaffirms its strong support for the Moroccan autonomy initiative, which convincingly serves as a realistic compromise in accordance with United Nations resolutions.
Developments in the Horn of Africa also continue to be a source of serious concern. We request the leaders of the region and the international community to explore new options to restore peace in the area. We must equally come together to jointly assist the region to combat terrorism through greater cooperation and intelligence sharing. The humanitarian crisis is enormous and calls for considerable international emergency aid.
Reverting to other important matters of global concern, we entreat the Unites States to end the longstanding embargo imposed on Cuba. The reason is that global solidarity and friendly cooperation should define relations among States Members of the United Nations.
In the Middle East, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict needs a new impetus for lasting peace. As a people, the Palestinians deserve a State of their own; we therefore call for a fresh peace initiative that includes the revival of the Arab Peace Initiative.
We remain deeply disturbed by the horrors and humanitarian catastrophe arising from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. The destabilizing global economic conditions imposed on the rest of the world are unbearable. In Africa and elsewhere, the cost-of- living crisis and the biting inflation, along with food and energy insecurity, are devastating our economies and continue to frustrate pandemic recovery efforts. Additionally, the debt burden has reached crisis levels. We call for general debt relief. We implore Russia and Ukraine to heed the global plea for political dialogue and end the war. Africa is simply asking for global peace and friendly relations. Our survival and progress depend on global peace and stability.
The plight of the Rohingya remains a matter of grave concern to the Gambia. We call on the Myanmar Government to comply with the rulings of the International Court of Justice and end all human rights violations against the Rohingya. The Gambia will continue to defend their rights.
As a responsible member of the international community, the Gambia considers Taiwan a part of the People’s Republic of China and advocates the adoption of the One China Policy. We urge the international community, therefore, to fully respect China’s sovereignty over Taiwan and avoid actions that undermine global peace.
The Gambia fully supports the Secretary-General’s call for transformation and global solidarity in the landmark report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982). In the same vein, we support his efforts to convene the Summit of the Future and the Sustainable Development Goals Summit next year. The renewal of global solidarity and regard for the less fortunate necessitate that we commit ourselves once again to leaving no one behind.
Africa will continue to demand its rightful place in the permanent membership category of the Security Council; thus, the negotiations must produce tangible results.
Finally, let me emphasize that genuine commitment and substantially increased resources should accompany the transformation of our institutions, systems, mechanisms and state of preparedness, and the developing world must not be left behind. I pray that we have a successful seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly."
Georgia,GEO,Asia,"  4,003,000 ",10483,11.60200024,4.7,73.6,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,367,9.17,"  4,003,000 ",100.00,8.27,"On behalf of the Georgian people, it is an honour to speak to members again at the General Assembly.
As we gather for the seventy-seventh session, we reflect on our founding principles and the progress we have made as an international community since the creation of the United Nations. At the first session held in 1946, the founders vowed to unite to maintain global peace and security. While we have made significant advances, we must acknowledge the ongoing acts of aggression against members of this organ — the very same types of action that led to the establishment of the United Nations after the Second World War.
In 2008, my country, Georgia, was attacked by Russia, resulting in the ongoing occupation of 20 per cent of our territory. At the time, the international community recognized that aggression. But as we have learned, the world’s democracies must act as one to ensure that freedom and peace prevail. The United Nations was founded to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and protect State sovereignty and territorial integrity. That is our duty. That is our promise.
Today I have the privilege of representing Georgia — a strong, proud, freedom-loving nation that has preserved its sacred heritage and history, while also evolving and adapting to the geopolitical realities of the twenty-first century. Thirty years ago, Georgia became part of the United Nations family. Now more than ever, we are committed to protecting our shared values, in our region and worldwide.
We seek all opportunities for collaboration with our international partners to advance the cause of peace. In that regard, the Geneva International Discussions are particularly crucial for bringing the Russian Federation to the table to address the implementation of the 2008 ceasefire agreement mediated by the European Union (EU). Georgia appreciates the international community’s support for its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Although my country is still occupied by Russia, we do not let that difficult challenge define us. We continue to punch above our weight and contribute to the international community. Since our Government came to power in 2012, we have implemented an ambitious reform agenda that has brought us closer to our key international partners, the EU, the United States, NATO and the United Nations. For the first time since we regained independence, Georgia and the Georgian people have enjoyed an unprecedented decade of peace, prosperity and stability. We are continuously working on Georgia’s global positioning and are already reaping the rewards.
According to the World Justice Project’s Rule of Law Index 2021, Georgia is first in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The Open Budget Survey 2021 ranked Georgia first in the world in terms of budget transparency. And according to the Fraser Institute’s Economic Freedom of the World: 2021 Annual Report, Georgia is among the top five economies, along with Singapore and Switzerland. NUMBEO named Georgia one of the world’s safest countries, ranking it fourteenth globally.
Our work to align more closely with the United States and Europe goes hand and hand with our commitment to continued democratic transformation. Increased Euro-Atlantic and European integration is our way of returning to the family of European nations, with which we share history, culture and — most important — values. We are continuing on our unequivocal path towards European and Euro- Atlantic integration.
Our commitment to those goals is backed up by actions and real results, including an Association Agreement with the EU, the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area and a visa-free travel arrangement with the EU. This year, we applied for full EU membership. The historic decision of the European Council to recognize the European perspective of Georgia created a new set of benchmarks. Just as in the past, Georgia will meet and exceed those benchmarks.
The prospect of acceding to the EU is strong motivation for our country and our citizens. We are fully aware that the European perspective comes with the responsibility to achieve the highest political, economic and legal convergence with the European Union. Georgia immediately responded to the European Council’s decision by presenting a very concrete action plan to address the Union’s 12 priorities. That inclusive process ensures the full engagement of all branches of the Government, the opposition parties and civil society. Working groups have been established in Parliament for each priority area with all relevant stakeholders. We are making progress and are well ahead of schedule. Let me be clear: Georgia deserves EU member candidate status, which will bring us to eventual membership and make the dream of generations a reality.
We have developed a long-term development strategy — Vision 2030 — a nationwide policy document that covers the key directives and priorities of our general development by 2030 and fully complies with the 2020 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Georgia also has in place a new national strategy for human rights protection for the years 2022-2030. The Government approved that strategy following discussions with both international partners and domestic civil society organizations. It aims to further improve human rights protection standards and is in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. It is a comprehensive document that covers all fundamental human rights and freedoms.
We are working with the world’s leading firms and brightest minds to transform Georgia into a true multidimensional regional hub. Our financial services sector is globally recognized, and we now attract international investors, injecting additional funds into the education and health-care sectors. The startup ecosystem is thriving, and the logistics and energy potential have been realized. Collectively, those developments have created a sustainable and predictable economy for Georgia and its people.
Our Government’s sound policies led to a strong recovery from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, with economic growth that reached 10.4 per cent in 2021 and far exceeded expectations from January to July 2022, at 10.3 per cent. According to the International Monetary Fund, our growth projections have reached 9 per cent for 2022, primarily due to our Government’s proactive measures to minimize the impacts of post-COVID-19 recovery and the war in Ukraine.
We are creating opportunities and giving all the necessary tools to our citizens, including those living in Georgia’s occupied territories. For that reason, here today at the General Assembly I would like to speak directly to my Abkhaz and Ossetian brothers and sisters and once again tell them that our strength is in unity. We will build Georgia together and peacefully turn it into a prosperous, free and unified European State.
War is raging again, not far from my country’s doorstep. Russia’s full-fledged war in Ukraine undermines that country’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, as well as the Charter of the United Nations and the fundamental principles of international law.
Georgia stands with Ukraine. Since the start of the war, my Government has provided substantial humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, including the allocation of more than 1,000 tons of humanitarian aid. Georgia is providing financial assistance and accommodation to more than 32,000 Ukrainians currently residing in Georgia. The Georgian education system has enrolled more than 1,500 Ukrainian students, many of whom receive general education in the Ukrainian language according to the standard Ukrainian curriculums.
We have sponsored, joined or supported almost 400 resolutions, statements, joint statements and other initiatives made or proposed by major international organizations and institutions in support of Ukraine and were among the main sponsors of resolution ES-11/2, on the humanitarian consequences of the aggression against Ukraine.
As confirmed by the United States Department of State report on the investment climate in Georgia, the National Bank of Georgia and Georgian financial institutions act fully in accordance with the financial sanctions imposed by the United States and others on the Russian Federation. We have aligned with the restrictive measures imposed by the European Union against Crimea and Sevastopol as of 2014 and those imposed against Donetsk and Luhansk as of this year.
As the conflict in Ukraine has shown, the wider security of the Black Sea is at the forefront of the Euro- Atlantic security agenda. Georgia, as an indivisible part of the regional architecture, is ready to increase our contribution to common security. As we know well, security brings stability and stability brings
predictability, which is a crucial precondition for sustainable economic development.
Therefore, the more predictable the Black Sea region becomes, the more we can unlock its economic potential for the benefit of our people and the global economy. For that reason, we are developing strategic transport corridors to connect Asia with Europe. Georgia is participating in several international initiatives and infrastructure projects with our European colleagues in order to improve connectivity and facilitate reliable and efficient commerce across the Black Sea.
Despite the complex situation in our region, we spare no effort to foster rapprochement between our neighbours. We have already had success stories, including the safe return of 15 Armenian detainees to their homeland in exchange for maps of mined territories in Azerbaijan. In July of this year, the Foreign Ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia met in Tbilisi for the first time.
We are ready to serve as a venue for that dialogue to bring much-needed peace and stability to our region. With that in mind, Georgia has been promoting the Peaceful Neighbourhood Initiative, which envisions participation by all three States of the South Caucasus. That new initiative does not substitute, counter or oppose any other cooperation formats. Georgia wishes to serve as an honest broker to aid in normalizing regional relations.
We are also heavily investing in our country’s infrastructure in order to increase Georgian transit capabilities for the benefit of the region. We aim to attract greater institutional foreign investment, facilitate projects of regional importance and strengthen our infrastructural capabilities, thereby becoming an actual bridge between East and West. Our goal is to transform the South Caucasus into a region of opportunity and economic growth.
We are already discussing with our EU counterparts a list of flagship projects that will bring about additional economic synergies and serve as a catalyst for more connectivity and integration with the European Union and European markets. We believe that all countries of the South Caucasus and allies from the West will benefit from that collaboration. We must act now to secure the Black Sea, protect energy routes, maintain supply chains and increase regional connectivity in order to foster greater economic development. Those actions are all essential to European peace and prosperity.
We are mindful that our regional challenges must be addressed against the backdrop of global challenges, such as international security, the ongoing pandemic and climate change. Georgia is contributing to global peace and the rules-based international order. For more than two decades, Georgia has contributed to NATO missions around the world, serving as one of the largest per capita contributors to the mission in Afghanistan. We have lost many brave soldiers and suffered significant casualties, with hundreds wounded in those missions. Georgia reiterates its readiness to stand by NATO in protecting common security while continuing to support EU-led missions.
As I speak here today, dangers that we can no longer ignore are threatening all of humankind. The planetary crises created by climate change, from biodiversity loss to pollution, represent an existential threat. Like many challenges, climate change affects developing nations first, hindering their ability to realize the Sustainable Development Goals.
In Georgia, our Government has made significant investments in education, public health and the environment in order to ensure that future generations can thrive. Education systems are critical for empowering prosperous and productive societies. Education in the twenty-first century means investing in digital literacy and promoting infrastructure in order to bridge the digital divide and ensure that future crises, whether related to public health, war or climate change, do not create dire situations.
In conclusion, I believe that, working together, we shall return peace and prosperity to our homes and countries. That has been the spirit and the mandate vested in the United Nations from its founding — to support and ensure peace and cooperation. I am proud to represent my country before the Assembly today. After three decades of restored independence, Georgian dreams are becoming a reality. Our nation, the history of which goes back thousands of years, has in recent decades become an example of resilience and progress in the face of extraordinary challenges. With our international partners, I am confident that we will build a brighter, more peaceful and prosperous world, now and for the generations to follow."
Germany,DEU,Europe,"  83,124,000 ",46841,3.75,7.1,81.18,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,10284,12.37,"  83,124,000 ",100.00,11.03,"It is with humility and deep respect that I address the General Assembly today — both as the newly elected Chancellor of Germany and as a proud representative to our United Nations.
My country and the United Nations are indivisibly linked. Today’s democratic and reunited Germany owes its role on the world stage to our international friends and partners who placed their trust in us to become and to remain a peace-loving member of the international community. We know that we owe our freedom, our stability and our prosperity to an international order with the United Nations at its core. Therefore, my
country’s commitment to this Organization and its noble goals — peace, development and equal rights and dignity for every human being — will never wane.
Unfortunately, I am expressing that commitment at a time when we are getting further away from those noble goals. After decades during which we overcame walls and blocs — a time when we marked the fall of the Iron Curtain and German reunification. After the technological revolution of the Internet and the digital transformation, which have made us more interconnected than ever before, we are now facing a new fragmentation of the world.
New wars and conflicts have emerged. Major global crises are piling up before us and are combining and reinforcing one another. Some have even seen this as a harbinger of a world without rules. It is true that the risks to our global order are real. And yet I do not hold with the image of a world without rules — for two reasons:
First, our world has clear rules. Rules that we, the United Nations, created together. The Charter of the United Nations promises all of us freedom and peaceful coexistence. This Charter is our collective rejection of a world without rules. Our problem is not the absence of rules. Our problem is the lack of willingness to abide by them and enforce them.
But the image of a world without rules leads us astray for a second reason. If we do not defend, further develop and strengthen our global order together, then it is not chaos without rules that we face, but a world in which the rules are made by those who can dictate them to us by dint of their military, economic or political power.
The alternative to a rules-based world is not anarchy, but the dominion of the strong over the weak. The vast majority of us cannot be indifferent to whether the rule of power or the power of rules wins the day. The key question that we as an international community face is this — should we stand helplessly by and watch as some seek to cast us back into a global order in which war is a common instrument of politics, in which independent nations have to submit to their stronger neighbours or their colonial masters, in which prosperity and human rights are a privilege of the lucky few? Or will we manage to stand together and ensure that the multipolar world of the twenty-first century remains a multilateral world? My answer, as a German and a European, is this: we have to manage that. We will manage that if we take three fundamental principles to heart.
First, the international order does not happen by itself. If we do nothing, then the Charter is but a piece of paper. The Charter calls on all of us to uphold its purposes and principles.
We must not stand idly by when a major nuclear Power, armed to the teeth — a founding Member of the United Nations and a permanent member of the Security Council, no less — seeks to shift borders through the use of violence. There is no justification whatsoever for Russia’s war of occupation against Ukraine. President Putin is waging that war with one single objective: to seize Ukraine. Self-determination and political independence do not count for him.
There is only one word for that. It is imperialism, plain and simple. The return of imperialism is not only a disaster for Europe; it is also a disaster for our global peaceful order, which is the antithesis of imperialism and neocolonialism. That is why it was so important that, here in this Hall, 141 countries categorically condemned Russia’s war of occupation (see resolution ES-11/1).
But that alone is not enough. If we want the war to end, we cannot be indifferent to how it ends. Putin will give up his war and his imperialist ambitions only if he realizes that he cannot win. In doing so, he is not just destroying Ukraine but is also ruining his own country.
That is why we will not accept a peace dictated by Russia. That is why we will not accept any sham referendums. That is why Ukraine must be able to defend itself against Russia’s invasion.
We are supporting Ukraine with all our might—financially, economically and with humanitarian assistance, as well as with weapons. Together with our partners around the world, we imposed tough economic sanctions on the Russian leadership and Russia’s economy. That is how we are making good on a promise that each and every of our countries made when joining the United Nations, namely, to join forces to maintain international peace and security.
There is one more thing that I would like to add, which is that not one sack of grain has been held back on account of those sanctions. Russia alone has prevented Ukrainian grain ships from putting out to sea, bombing ports and destroying agricultural enterprises.
“Where hunger prevails, there can be no peace.” (A/PV2128, p.3). My predecessor, Nobel Peace Prize winner Willy Brandt, said that when he addressed this Assembly in 1973, as the first Federal Chancellor to do so. Today we are witnessing that that sentence also works the other way around. Those who want there to be no hunger must ensure that Putin’s war does not prevail — this war that even in countries far away from Russia is leading to rising prices, energy scarcity and famine.
The fact that grain exports have been made possible once again thanks to the mediation efforts of Secretary- General Guterres and Tiirkiye deserves great respect. Germany is also supporting Ukraine with the export of food, and we will stand by Ukraine when it comes to shouldering the enormous costs of rebuilding the country. At an international expert conference that I will host with the President of the European Commission in Berlin on 25 October, together with supporters of Ukraine from all around the world, we will think about how we can manage that Herculean task.
Our message is this: we stand firmly at the side of those under attack, for the protection of the lives and the freedom of the Ukrainian people and for the protection of our international order.
The second principle for preserving that order is as follows. All of us will be judged against the obligations that we have jointly entered into. Responsibility always begins at home. Let us take climate change, for example, which is the biggest challenge of our generation. We, the industrialized countries and major emitters of greenhouse-gases, have a very special responsibility in that regard.
With that in mind, we reiterated our intention at the Group of Seven (G-7) Summit in Germany in June to forge ahead in order to achieve the 1.5°C target, not despite the war and the energy crisis, but precisely because climate neutrality also leads to greater energy security.
We stand by our pledges to support emerging economies and developing countries in their efforts to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change, with new, fair energy transition partnerships, for example. We will not abandon countries that are struggling the most in the face of loss and damage as a result of climate change.
By the time of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Egypt, we therefore want to establish a global shield against climate risks. Our yardstick must be the obligations that we have entered into. Nowhere does that insight seem more obvious to me than in the protection of human rights, since they reflect the deepest need of each and every one of us to live our lives in freedom, unharmed and in dignity. That lies at the heart of what makes us humans, who we are and what we have in common, no matter where we come from, no matter what we believe and no matter whom we love.
I say that with the history of my country in mind. Germany, which betrayed all civilized values with the murder of 6 million Jews, an act that is without parallel, is aware of just how fragile our civilization is. At the same time, we have an obligation to respect and defend human rights at all times and in all places.
My country is the second-largest donor to the United Nations system and the second-largest donor of humanitarian assistance. In Germany in recent years, we have taken in millions of refugees from the Middle East, Africa, Afghanistan and, most recently, Ukraine. That is something of which we are proud.
But we also have to pay heed and take action in places where hundreds of thousands are made to endure suffering, tyranny and torture in prison camps or jails, such as in North Korea, Syria, Iran and Belarus. We must pay heed and take action when the Taliban deprive women and girls in Afghanistan of their most basic rights, and we must pay heed and take action when Russia commits war crimes in Mariupol, Bucha and Irpin. We will bring the murderers to justice.
We are doing everything in our power to support the International Criminal Court and the Independent International Committee of Inquiry on Ukraine, established by the Human Rights Council.
Particularly those who bear particular responsibility for our order in the world by dint of their strength and their influence should have an interest in bolstering our common institutions.
The former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights briefed us about the situation of the Uighurs in Xinjiang a few weeks ago. China should implement the High Commissioner’s recommendations. That would be a sign of sovereignty and strength and a guarantee of change for the better.
A third principle must be taken into consideration if we are to preserve the international order. We must adapt our rules and institutions to the reality of the twenty-first century. Far too often, those rules and institutions reflect the world of 30, 50 or 70 years ago.
That also goes for the Security Council. For many years, Germany has been committed to its reform and its expansion, first and foremost to include the countries of the global South. Germany is also prepared to assume greater responsibility as a permanent member and, initially, as a non-permanent member for the term from 2027 to 2028.
I kindly ask Member States to support our candidacy — the candidacy of a country that respects the principles of the United Nations and offers and seeks cooperation. To my mind, it is entirely natural that the up-and-coming, dynamic countries and regions of Asia, Africa and Latin America must be given a stronger political voice on the world stage. That is in all of our interests, as it gives rise to joint responsibility and greater acceptance of our decisions.
Nationalism and isolation will not solve the challenges of our age. More cooperation, more partnership and more involvement are the only reasonable response, whether in the fight against climate change, global health risks, inflation and disrupted supply chains or our approach to displacement and migration. I say that with profound conviction. The insight that openness and cooperation safeguard peace and prosperity has made the past decades the happiest in the history of my country so far.
As President of the G-7 this year, it is therefore a key priority for me to promote a new form of cooperation with the countries of the global South that not only claims to take place on a level playing field, but one on which actors genuinely see eye to eye, especially since that level playing field has long existed de facto if we consider the increasing political, economic and demographic influence of Asia, Africa and Latin America.
From the outset, we coordinated our objectives very closely with Indonesia, as the holder of the Group of 20 presidency. We have involved the countries holding the chairmanship of the African Union and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, as well as India and South Africa, in our G-7 discussions.
That gave rise to new models of global cooperation that have one thing in common, namely, the fact that they are characterized by joint responsibility and mutual solidarity. We are fighting the hunger crisis with a new Alliance for Global Food Security, and I would like to invite all Member States to join the Alliance. We launched the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment in order to jointly mobilize $600 billion for public and private infrastructure investments around the world over the next five years. In doing so, we are taking a big step towards implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. With a newly emerging climate club, we are pressing ahead with friends and partners worldwide to implement the Paris Agreement on Climate Change even more swiftly and efficiently.
Such approaches are pillars that support our international order because they deliver results from which citizens in all our countries stand to benefit and that they expect from the United Nations. “We the peoples” — it is not for nothing that those are the first three words of our Charter. We should note that those words are not “We the Member States” or “We the representatives”.
We have an obligation to our peoples. We owe them a global order that allows them to live in peace, which protects their rights and which opens up opportunities for education, health and development for them. Such an order does not come about by itself. Defending, further developing and strengthening it is our task as the United Nations. Germany extends the hand of cooperation to all Member States in that endeavour."
Greece,GRC,Europe,"  10,522,000 ",24689,21.48999977,5.4,82.072,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,533,5.07,"  10,522,000 ",100.00,9.96,"Seventy-seven years ago, the Organization was founded out of the chaos of war with one stated aim: the harmonization of relations among nation States in pursuit of lasting peace and security, the defence of human rights and the inviolability of international law. It was the world’s first multilateral response to the aggression of the few at the expense of the many.
And yet, in spite of all its successes, today our United Nations stands at a crossroads. As the theme of this year’s General Assembly suggests, we face a watershed moment in world history. We face a choice, and that choice is simple. We can come together to face down the forces of authoritarianism and violence of today, in full cognizance that there is a price to pay for defending our common human values, or we can show indecision, we can waver and, ultimately, we can fold. If we choose the former, however painful in the short term that may be, the values that underpin these United Nations will prevail; choose the latter and the consequences are, I believe, unimaginable.
For our societies to survive and thrive, they have to be willing to fight when faced with unprovoked aggression. Pericles, in his funeral oration, made that absolutely clear 2,500 years ago. At no time since the end of the Second World War have his words echoed more relevantly.
Today the memories of the dark continent have resurfaced after the unprovoked invasion of Russia into Ukraine. What we considered unthinkable has happened. For many years, we believed that international cooperation and a shared commitment to the rule of law had prevailed over guns and armies. We believed that, given the tragic and devastating experiences of the twentieth century, no one would venture to suppress another people’s right to exist or alter borders by force. We were wrong.
Nevertheless, as Europeans we have every reason to be proud of our response. We have stood by Ukraine, equipping it with means to defend itself against the aggressor. We have imposed punitive sanctions that are beginning to take a toll on the Russian economy. And the tide is beginning to turn. This clear and strong position against an unjustified war is the reflection of a new geopolitical vision for the European Union. We do not want a world in which power is for the strong State and not for the weak, and where disputes are settled by generals rather than diplomats.
Russia’s invasion must not succeed, not only for the sake of Ukraine but also because it is imperative to send a clear message to other authoritarian leaders that open acts of aggression that violate international law shall not be tolerated by the global community of democratic States. That message had been sent loud and clear by many Heads of State and Government who have taken the floor in this year’s general debate.
Across Europe, we face the prospect of a difficult winter. The impact of the war in Ukraine has sent the price of gas soaring and has unleashed a spike in inflation, the likes of which we have not seen in more than four decades. Russia has weaponized its natural resources to inflict pain on European societies and destabilize democratically elected European Governments. Again, it will not succeed.
We will support our citizens in coping with high energy prices. We will pool European resources to promote energy efficiency and rapidly diversify away from Russian oil and natural gas. And we will further accelerate the push towards renewables, which are not just the cleanest and cheapest form energy, but are also the safest ones from a geopolitical perspective. Never again must we mortgage our prosperity, only to be blackmailed by those who are willing to exploit our dependencies. That is, after all, what European strategic autonomy is all about.
We know that there is a price to be paid for being on the right side of history, and it is our obligation to keep our societies united but also informed about what is really at stake in Ukraine. The fight against disinformation and fake news must continue with increased vigour. Pericles, in his funeral oration was correct when he said that it is not easy to find the right measure of words when one cannot quite rely on a common perception of the truth.
Ukraine is not the only country in post-war Europe to have been brutally attacked. For nearly 50 years, Cypriots have lived on a divided island as the result of an illegal invasion and a military occupation. Ankara and the Turkish-Cypriot leadership, isolated and alone in the international community, continue to insist upon unacceptable demands for a two-State solution. They refuse to resume negotiations for an agreed settlement on the basis of successive Security Council resolutions. Greece strongly supports both the Secretary-General’s efforts to resume negotiations for a mutually acceptable settlement, and the confidence-building measures proposed by the President of the Republic of Cyprus, Mr. Nicos Anastasiades. But the international community must not ignore illegal Turkish attempts to impose a new fait-accompli on Cyprus, in particular in the fenced area of Varosha, as well as new and repeated violations of Cyprus’ maritime zones and airspace.
That brings me to an issue even closer to home for my country. I am referring to Tiirkiye’s continued and ever-more aggressive revisionist agenda vis-a-vis Greece. This is my fourth address to the General Assembly as Greek Prime Minister. Members have heard me say before that I am always open to dialogue and to the settling of differences in an open, respectful manner and in accordance with international law. That is still the case.
Tiirkiye after all is an important country, a NATO member that can be a partner and ally of Greece and the European Union if it so chooses. Tiirkiye has a great capacity to play a constructive role. For example, Ankara’s recent efforts that led to a successful United Nations brokering of a grain exports deal between Ukraine and Russia was an important contribution to global food security.
But at the same time, Tiirkiye continues to play a destabilizing role in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Middle East and the Caucasus. It is also the only NATO country not implementing sanctions against Russia. When it comes to Greece, Tiirkiye’s leadership seems to have a strange fixation with my country. Their language is increasingly bellicose. They threaten that Tiirkiye will “come at night”, if it so decides. This is the language of an aggressor, not a peacemaker. Sadly, it is nothing new.
And what of Tiirkiye’s challenge to Greek sovereignty in the Aegean itself? Again, such rhetoric not new. Tiirkiye has been incrementally building a comprehensive narrative of false claims in the Aegean that stretches from the Imia islet crisis in the mid-1990s to the present day. It has been threatening Greece with a casus belli should we choose to exercise our sovereign right to expand our territorial waters in the Aegean. That narrative has, unfortunately, culminated in Tiirkiye’s preposterous challenge last year of Greek sovereignty over the eastern Aegean islands, including islands such as Chios and Rhodes — a sovereignty that was established by international treaties 100 years ago.
What is particularly alarming is the growing intensity of the threat. It is characterized by an escalation in aggressive rhetoric, combined with a massive disinformation campaign, multiple violations of Greece’s sovereignty and sovereign rights at sea and in the air, the instrumentalization of migration flows and, unfortunately, a unilateral decision to refuse all high-level contacts.
I ask: Is this behaviour compatible with a well- established international actor, a United Nations Member State bound by the Charter and principles of
the United Nations? Such actions undermine peace and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean at a time when the international community is faced with a war in Ukraine. If President Erdogan wants to talk about red lines, then I say this: Turkish claims over the sovereignty of Greece’s islands are baseless and unacceptable. Questioning the sovereignty of Greek territory crosses a red line for all Greeks. As Prime Minister of Greece, I will never compromise on my country’s territorial integrity, security and stability. Greece will not be bullied by anyone.
And yet, it does not have to be that way. There is another path forward. Greek people and Turkish people have a history of peaceful coexistence. Eight years after the tragic events of 1922, Greek and Turkish leaders had the courage to sign a peace and friendship agreement. That is why today, from the United Nations, I would like to address not just the Turkish leadership but also the Turkish people directly with this message — Greece poses no threat to their country. We are not their enemy. We are neighbours. We value the many friendships between ordinary Greeks and Turks. I know that the vast majority in our two countries do not want political conflict and hostility, so let us move forward in a spirt of cooperation and friendship, with mutual respect and in accordance with international law.
Let me also make a specific reference to the migration situation in the Aegean. Tiirkiye has been instrumentalizing migrants since March 2020, when it actively encouraged and facilitated tens of thousands of desperate people to illegally cross into Greece in order to put pressure on the European Union. I want to be absolutely clear. Greece will continue to protect its borders, with full respect to fundamental rights. Our Coast Guard has saved tens of thousands of people at sea. It did so again yesterday, when we rescued more than 130 people, including many children, from two sinking boats in the Aegean. It would be much more useful for Tiirkiye to cooperate actively with Greece and Europe on the issue of migration rather than spreading fake news. After all, the boats carrying the same desperate people to whom President Erdogan keeps referring leave the Turkish coast in broad daylight.
Let me conclude with a point about meeting the momentous challenges of climate change. The green transformation sits at the heart of my Government’s reform programme. Our National Climate Law is aimed at mobilizing all sectors of the economy as we establish a road map for our transition to net zero by 2050. The conversion of a number of Greek islands into green innovation hubs is up and running.
And for Greece there is another fight close to our hearts. It is the battle to protect cultural heritage, not just from climate change, but from armed conflict, illicit trafficking and its interconnection with terrorist financing, and religious fundamentalism. Greece, in partnership with UNESCO and the World Meteorological Organization, has launched the Addressing Climate Change Impacts on Cultural and Natural Heritage initiative, supported by more than 100 Member States, the Secretary General, the Council of Europe and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We invite all Member States to join us in this effort.
I am pleased to say that in our long and continuing effort to reunite the Parthenon sculptures back in Greece, we have received support from the vast majority of Member States, as well as from the UNESCO Intergovernmental Committee. We thank them for that support. No matter how long it will take, the Parthenon sculptures will eventually be coming home.
I am immensely proud of the fact that Greece is one of few countries that have not deviated from the United Nations 17 Sustainability Goals for 2030. Let me highlight in particular our commitment to transforming public education, in line with Goal 4. Our efforts have been recognized at this year’s Assembly. As the world’s leading shipping nation, we understand that the sustainability of our marine environment is of paramount importance. That is why, in 2024, we will be hosting the ninth international Our Ocean Conference, building on our ambitious plans to promote sustainable fishing and protect 30 per cent of our land and sea by 2030. All these initiatives prove that collective multilateral solutions can make a significant difference in the battle to protect our natural world.
But, as many speakers have pointed out, we are not there yet. Whether it be the terrifying wildfires we witnessed in Europe this summer, or more recently the unprecedented flooding that have affected large parts of Pakistan or the continued loss of critical icecaps, glaciers and rainforests, without multilateral cooperation these events may soon be the norm rather than the exception. Greece is taking the lead in making sure that European countries cooperate more effectively in the field of civil protection through the rescEU programme. As the United Kingdom hands on the baton and the work of the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to Egypt for the twenty-seventh Conference, we have a final chance to get this right. Let us not be asking at the next General Assembly why we are still talking and not acting.
The challenges our world faces our complex and multifaceted. The solutions are far from simple. They require compromise, effort and will. They require resolve and determination. Above all, they require us to work together and stay the course. That, after all, is the spirit of these United Nations. In pursuit of freedom, the preservation of democracy and the rule of law, and the fight against climate change, there is indeed a long road ahead. The next generation will judge us very harshly should we fail to rise to the occasion."
Guatemala,GTM,North America,"  17,248,000 ",7137,2.734999895,6.6,74.063,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Lower Respiratory Infection,1039,6.02,"  16,740,093 ",97.06,6.30,"I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your excellent leadership and the important theme chosen for this session, which invites us to reflect at a critical time in history to address the various crises that are affecting the peaceful coexistence of humankind. We have come to think that wars lead to the society of nations that led to the establishment of the United Nations, that peace was going to be forever and that the achievements of social conquests that cost humankind so much would be forever. But, over the years, we woke up from that dream to find ourselves in a divided world, tainted and at odds. Today we need to come together to seek solutions, not cease to find them, to once again speak out and to once again discuss and debate.
But this time it cannot be once again, This time we need to look around us and take a decisive step forward. It is now or never.
With the same will with which we addressed the challenges posed by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic less than two years ago, with that same momentum, we have worked to overcome its effects and the consequence of other global events that have shown how interdependent we are as human beings. The threat of COVID-19 remains, but not to the extent of the critical phase of the pandemic, when many countries faced serious problems by not having equitable access to the global vaccines market. Tens of thousands of lives could have been saved.
However, in many cases, the hoarding of vaccines was a reality. COVID-19 showed us that there are situations and threats that do not recognize borders or groups, that all States in the world are vulnerable and that we are not prepared to deal with globally, and especially cooperatively. However, it is important to emphasize that we can succeed if we join forces.
Striking a balance between the health of people and the economy in the midst of the pandemic and always seeking the common good is one of the great challenges we have taken on — with very good results.
The Guatemalan Government adopted a countercyclical fiscal policy and a prudent monetary and credit policy that contributed to the early recovery of economic activity, with an 8 per cent growth in gross domestic product in 2021. That growth has been corroborated and highlighted by the three main credit rating agencies and other international organizations.
We also face the constant threat of the effects of climate change, which are becoming more evident, dangerous and extensive every year. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, those have exceeded the damages in my country since 1998 by more than $6 billion.
As we did last year, Guatemala and the rest of Central America and the Caribbean want to call attention to the ravages caused by climate change in our region. We continue to recover from the damage caused by natural disasters this year and in previous years without the industrialized world, which is the real culprit of this catastrophe, responding with solutions to what they have caused.
In Guatemala we have made efforts to rehabilitate basic services, rebuild public infrastructure and recover agricultural and livestock production. We have assisted entire communities.
My country is megadiverse, one of 20 countries that is home to more than 70 per cent of the planet’s biological diversity and constantly faces threats that endanger the natural heritage, not only of Guatemala but of humankind. My Government has given new impetus to forestry concessions in the department of north Peten. In January 2020, there were a total of 250,000 hectares under concession that form the Maya Biosphere Reserve, one of the main lungs of the continent and the world.
Previous Administrations did not pay attention to the renewal of those forest concessions. In just two and a half years, my Administration doubled them, reaching
approximately 550,000 hectares, which, in addition, benefit thousands of families, who do not pillage the forest, but rather protect it, even against fires and those who live off the forest with adequate forestry plans. The model of forest concessions in charge of communities really works. It enables local economic development and is a barrier against the impact of climate change. That has been recognized by nations and important environmental protection groups.
Similarly, agricultural insurance was implemented in order to support small producers who, due to drought or flooding caused by climate change, are in danger of losing everything and must emigrate if they do. With that insurance, they recover their investment and can continue to grow their crops. More than 50,000 farmers have already been reached, and many thousands remain.
With a view to meeting our climate change mitigation commitments, we are promoting the formulation of a national decarbonization policy. In addition, we updated our nationally determined contribution and are promoting important strategies that, in the medium term, will help mitigate the impact of emissions from vehicles that use fossil fuels. Proof of that is the recent approval, at the behest of the executive branch, of a law on incentives for electric mobility, which promotes the use and marketing of electric vehicles and cleaner energy.
Guatemala continues to comply with its own energy policy. We estimate that, by the year 2032, more than 80 per cent of Guatemala’s electrical energy will be produced from renewable sources.
In addition, the growing crisis of food and nutritional insecurity is leaving us more famine and more lives to mourn, with the indolence of countries that have more towards countries that have little or nothing.
The irregular migration process is a multicausal phenomenon. People migrate in search of better opportunities and better services. The economic factor and the effects of climate change are some of the main causes.
Our Government has worked on structural rather than short-term solutions, not short-term ones, which, looking to the future, is the only thing that can stop irregular migration. To that end, we enacted a series of laws that stimulate investment with the necessary legal certainty that enables job creation in order to meet the basic needs of the population, as well as a law that supports access to low-income housing. It is important to emphasize that only a comprehensive effort of that nature will prevent people from resorting to irregular migration, and thereby put their lives and scarce assets at risk.
The smuggling of migrants has become a national and transnational security issue. In Guatemala we have stopped massive irregular flows of migrants, better known as caravans, coming from countries in and out of the region. That is always done in full respect for human rights. In that connection, at the initiative of the executive branch, the law against the smuggling of migrants, known as the “law of coyotaje”, was adopted. Smuggling is a transnational crime, so I once again call on parties in the region, and especially the Governments of the region — be they countries of origin, transit or destination — to work together and to adopt a common approach to irregular migration and the necessary legislation in that regard.
We are facing a decisive moment. If we employ a shared approach, we will be able to reach transformative solutions to interconnected challenges, including those related to regional and transnational security.
We continue with the all-out war against drug trafficking, and I call on the consumer countries, which — as I said in my statement last year (see A/76/ PV.6) — are the ones that launder the most money. Unless the financial structures of the organizations dedicated to this crime — the proceeds of drug consumption — are not weakened, it will continue to be a threat to the future of countries such as ours.
State sovereignty is fundamental in bilateral and multilateral relations. No matter how big or small the countries, relations must be based on respectful treatment. Let us remember that no country, organization or multilateral entity can or should intervene in the internal affairs of other countries — but no, that is not always the case.
Globally, we are facing new crises, and many of them, unfortunately, are caused willingly by humans by disrespecting the sovereignty of States. This Organization must be more active in addressing the possibility of a third confrontation of major proportions.
However, the United Nations, as the guardian of international law and the centre for dialogue for the maintenance of peace and security among States, will not be able to solve the world’s problems without our
commitment — the State representatives — to respect international law and resolve our differences peacefully, on the basis of dialogue and negotiation, respecting the sovereignty of each State.
We are facing distressing levels of old hatreds, clear discriminatory rejection of nationalities, migrants and refugees, as well as other facts not seen since the end of the Second World War. Once again, we are witnessing scenarios of the use of force and violence of one State against another, nationalist ideological confrontations, the imposition of authoritarian views, with a clear rejection of democracy as a system, as well as massive human rights violations.
In that sense, Guatemala emphatically joins the global clamour for the cessation of the war in Ukraine and the threats against the sovereignty of Taiwan and Israel. We cannot allow the conflict in Ukraine to continue. I went to Ukraine and I know it to be true — this conflict must stop now. We must not allow this situation to be repeated in any country.
As President of Guatemala, I am the only Latin American Head of State to have visited Ukraine during this conflict. I saw the horrors of war, and I stand in solidarity and openly express my opposition to war — there or anywhere.
During the official visit, we were able to witness on the ground the precarious situation of the families of the country under attack, whose defenceless civilian population suffers the onslaught of a military force, including constant bombardment.
But peace is not the absence of war. A renewed United Nations Organization is called upon to generate conditions in the world that allow for the full development and well-being of populations.
As I stated recently in my speech in the city of Kyiv, I would like to refer to and pay attention to the words of the Charter of the United Nations. This Organization was created in order to
“save succeeding generations from the scourge of war ... to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, and to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained”.
The Charter further states:
“And for these ends to practice tolerance and
live together in peace with one another as good
neighbours, and to unite our strength to maintain
international peace and security”.
In view of the current world scenario, we urgently need to remember those purposes and principles that gave rise to this Organization and allow for the transformation of this organ in order to have more tools and resources to overcome global challenges.
Profound changes in the Security Council are urgent in order to assure the world of respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and the self- determination of peoples, but, above all, to guarantee peace. As a country with a pacifist vocation, Guatemala reiterates its request that the Security Council honour its responsibility without ideological bias, but, above all, that no countries can veto draft resolutions if they do not seek the authentic maintenance of peace.
The project of change cannot be postponed. The foundations of the United Nations must be modified so that it has the mechanisms that will enable it to respond to the main challenges of humankind, which so desperately needs peace and development. Guatemala calls on States to make rapid progress on a proposal, led by country experts, in order to define the fundamental reforms needed for the United Nations to return to the path it lost after its establishment in 1945.
The founding Charter, which came into being at the end of the Second World War and was amended on three different occasions, requires new approaches in keeping with the current times, which are difficult, but also full of opportunities.
The United Nations must secure the means to reform original commitments ranging from the sovereign equality of States to the prohibition of the use of force in international relations, including nuclear and chemical weapons of mass destruction. While reforms to the United Nations and the Security Council are being proposed, Guatemala urges nations to respect the founding Charter of the highest world Organization.
In addition to the United Nations reform initiative, supported by the majority of pacifist and democratic countries, measures must be taken in order to achieve drastic changes in key institutions of multilateralism, leaving aside ideologies that divide us and addressing the interconnected challenges faced by the world’s
population. Hunger and poverty have no ideology. We must focus on comprehensive development and provide transformative solutions to the great challenges.
Guatemala, one of the founding countries of the United Nations, has demonstrated its support and is ready to collaborate with an open spirit in the efforts to transform this Organization and multilateralism related to the bastion of international cooperation so as to include within those reforms the right of Taiwan to belong to this Organization and to be recognized as a nation, because it has been denied that right by one of the permanent members on the Security Council.
I want to state emphatically that peace is possible, and the commitment to its maintenance and international security is achievable. But we must voluntarily change our decisions and, as leaders, determine the direction and future of our societies. Let us seek peaceful coexistence among peoples and nations, set aside ethnic, cultural, social or religious differences and focus on what unites us. Let us be tolerant and respect different ways of thinking.
Guatemala is a peaceful country. We promote respect for, and compliance with, human rights, of the right to life since conception to natural death. Today, before this Assembly, I once again reaffirm my country’s firm commitment to serve continuously in the maintenance of peace in the world.
I want to reiterate that Guatemala, as a democratic country, is committed to permanently and definitively resolve before the International Court of Justice the territorial, insular and maritime dispute with Belize. We aspire to a privileged relationship with Belize for the peaceful settlement of common issues through dialogue, building diplomatic mechanisms on the basis of mutual trust in order to bring prosperity, calm and hope to our populations.
Guatemala shares the same interests and challenges with its Caribbean brothers, with whom we unite in a single voice to fight against climate change and its effects.
It is time to look beyond and remember the horrors of the two great wars that caused so much pain to the world. For the love of all that is sacred — it is now or never. No more fratricidal wars, no more unnecessary and unjustified conflicts, no more deaths. It is now or never. For the love of all that is sacred — let us bet on peace, let us bet on dialogue, let us bet on resolving problems as brothers do. It is now or never. Let us bet on peace. Succeeding generations and the preservation of the human race will thank us for it.
Let us concern ourselves with the real battles — fighting hunger, malnutrition, confronting climate change and so many other issues that affect the human race. Instead of taking up arms, let us take action to make the world a better place to live in peace, progress, development and peaceful coexistence between human beings and nature.
In these dark and difficult times, I raise my prayer for God to bless the entire world, but especially Guatemala."
Guinea,GIN,Africa,"  12,414,000 ",1668,4.485000134,5.3,61.185,Cardiovascular Disease,Lower Respiratory Infection,Malaria,892,7.19,"  5,545,170 ",44.67,4.57,"At the outset of my remarks, I wish to convey the warm congratulations of His Excellency Colonel Mamadi Doumbouya, Chair of the National Committee of Reconciliation and Development, President of the Transition, Head of State and Supreme Leader of the Armies of the Republic of Guinea, upon Mr. Csaba Korosi’s successful election as President of the United Nations General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session. I also wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for the outstanding work accomplished during his mandate.
I wish to express the appreciation and the deep gratitude of the Guinean authorities to the Secretary- General of the United Nations, Mr. Antonio Guterres, for the dynamic exercise of his mandate.
The Guinean delegation’s participation in this meeting allows us to provide information on the situation in our country and our assessment of the international situation. The Republic of Guinea, after having set the tone for independence in Africa, particularly in francophone countries, has nevertheless experienced dark times in its governance, and unfortunately the regime that ruled during the previous decade was no exception to the rule. That period was marked in particular by an extreme politicization of State bodies, violations of the rule of law and financial mismanagement.
Ultimately, the constitutional change abolishing the two-term limit for the presidency, orchestrated by the previous President, triggered sociopolitical unrest in a nation in which development had already been paralysed, despite the country being on the path to becoming the top producer of bauxite in the world.
Faced with that catastrophic situation and the need to prevent abuses of power, the country’s defence and security forces, united within the National Committee for Reconciliation and Development, made a decision. On 5 September 2021, in an expression of solidarity and patriotism, they decided to assume their responsibility to establish a Government of integrity that would benefit the Guinean population, particularly its women and youth, with the aim of achieving inclusive and sustainable development. The population supported those ideals and communicated their expectations during consultations between the National Committee for Reconciliation and Development (CNRD) and the country’s stakeholders. A stock-taking exercise was conducted to reach agreement on appropriate solutions to the challenges identified and to revive the country. The goal was an institutional correction to build strong and legitimate institutions that could stand the test of time and human frailty; the re-establishment of the foundations of the State to infuse a sense of ethics into public life and restore the State’s authority; a correction aimed at breaking with old practices to reform, modernize and renew the Administration; a gathering of the people as a whole to conduct public affairs in complete transparency; and respect for all commitments at the national and international levels.
In that respect, the following progress was made. The transition charter was drafted and published. A civilian transitional Government was established. The National Transition Council was established. The Court to Repress Economic and Financial Crimes was established to combat corruption and the diversion of public goods and to restore trust between the population and those in power. Looted State property was recovered. All proceedings are based on the full independence of the justice system. That is why the transitional President stressed, when he took power, that justice would be the compass of the life of our nation.
National symposiums, called days of truth and forgiveness, were held, and a report on the subject was submitted on 24 August. On that occasion, the Head of State entrusted me with the task of disseminating the report and following up on the recommendations that emerged from those days.
An inclusive consultation framework was established with the support of technical and financial partners. That is a platform that makes it possible for all the country’s stakeholders to exchange views on the conduct of the transition.
To carry out the transition in an inclusive and peaceful manner, the above-mentioned institutions have, in the exercise of their respective mandates, deployed missions within and outside the country to gather the opinions of Guinean citizens on the management of the transition and the country’s future. A proposed timeline was therefore agreed by consensus in order to prevent the people of Guinea from falling back into cyclical transitions.
With regard to the length of the transition, I wish to highlight the fact that a key issue of the negotiations between the Republic of Guinea and the Economic Community of West African States was the content of the transition, which covers 10 points, including a general census of the population and housing and an administrative census for civil registry purposes. Those two exercises will take 24 months to complete, and 12 additional months will be necessary for the holding of the three scheduled elections. I cannot stress enough the imperative to conduct a quality census to establish an indisputable electoral registry that will guarantee transparent electoral processes and results that are universally accepted. It should be recalled that the issue of the electoral registry has always been a point of contention and has led to various elections being contested in recent years.
In view of the outcome of the inclusive consultation framework and in line with his policy of outreach, the President of the transition created the framework for inclusive inter-Guinean dialogue, which has been placed under my authority. We hope that reluctant stakeholders will feel a burst of patriotic pride and join the dialogue. There is no obstacle today to inclusive dialogue in Guinea. It is important to note that, without any pressure being exerted, the members of the CNRD, the Government and the National Transition Council decided of their own free will that they would not run for office during the upcoming elections. That decision is constantly reaffirmed.
In terms of justice and human rights, the Guinean Government, in its respect for human rights, in addition to the judicial reforms under way, has made the organization of the trial for the events of 28 September 2009, during which there were victims, a national priority. In that regard, the transitional President decided to organize, after 13 years of waiting, day after day, the opening of the trial in cooperation with the International Criminal Court and the Human Rights Council.
On the economic front, strong measures have been taken to stabilize the macroeconomic framework to strengthen the country’s resilience. The development of an interim reference programme for the period from 2022 to 2025 will undoubtedly contribute to improving the living conditions of our people.
We would like to reassure all public and private investors of our Government’s determination to guarantee conditions conducive to a better business environment. An overhaul of public finances and reforms in the mining sector, in particular the setting of the index price of bauxite, will make it possible for the population to benefit from the dividends of the growth in that sector. We are committed to ensuring a careful consideration of the problems faced by the people of Guinea in order to find solutions that are sustainable for them — hence the imperative to establish the rule of law and strong institutions for a successful transition, which would be a clear guarantee of Guinea’s stability and, by extension, that of the West African subregion. We will also continue to cooperate with all our partners and respect our commitments in a spirit of openness and mutual trust and respect.
The seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when the world is facing a number of social, political and economic challenges at the dawn of a new multipolar world order. The theme chosen for this session, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, calls on all countries of the world to show more unity in action and more solidarity in order to resolve the complex challenges generated by the coronavirus disease crisis and the crises affecting regions providing basic food stuffs, agricultural inputs and petroleum products.
In that regard, my country appreciates the Secretary- General’s initiatives on international peace and security and the path to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. It also reiterates the need to redouble our efforts to achieve this goal, through preventive diplomacy, respect for human rights and international solidarity in the fight against climate change and debt forgiveness for the least developed countries.
My country shares the concerns of the international community on the issues of peace, security, development and human rights being examined by the United Nations and renews its traditional position on the search for peaceful and consensus solutions to
these issues. This is an opportunity for my delegation to point out that, with regard to peace operations, since 1961, the Republic of Guinea has deployed and continues to deploy military contingents as well as police and gendarmerie personnel in various peace missions throughout the world. It is on the strength of all this experience that the President of Guinea, Colonel Mamadi Doumbouya, an avowed pan-Africanist, has decided to deploy, in addition to the Guinean contingent in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali operating in Kidal, Mali since 2013, an additional contingent to replace that of Benin, whose mandate expires in 2023. Furthermore, my country reiterates its commitment and insists on the fight against climate change and irregular migration.
We are convinced that the United Nations remains indispensable to our world. However, it needs to be reformed in order to be fairer, more inclusive and better able to respond to the legitimate aspirations of the world’s peoples. It must adapt to the realities of the world, meet the many challenges facing humankind and maintain its central role in global governance. In this context, the Republic of Guinea attaches importance to the implementation of the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, which underpin the African Common Position, as declared by His Excellency Mr. Macky Sail, President of Senegal and Chairperson of the African Union, on Security Council reform.
The Republic of Guinea has adopted the same perspective as the United Nations in terms of inclusive dialogue, including with the Economic Community of West African States, being the guiding principle for our transition, strengthening the rule of law and promoting human rights and accountability with a view to mending a weakened national fabric. On behalf of the Guinean people, we thank our partners, in particular the United Nations system and bilateral and multilateral donors, for their support in this process.
Finally, my country reiterates its support for multilateralism, multilingualism and the revitalization of United Nations bodies, which are yet another asset for an international cooperation that is mutual, beneficial, inclusive and supportive of humankind and sustainable development, which is so much sought after and desired by the Member States. May God bless Guinea and the Guinean people. May God bless our planet."
Haiti,HTI,North America,"  11,123,000 ",1636,13.98799992,3.6,63.66,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Lower Respiratory Infection,1085,9.75,"  5,219,527 ",46.93,6.15,"Allow me to begin by conveying to the President the warm greetings of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Haiti, His Excellency Mr. Ariel Henry, who had to cancel his participation in the general debate at the last minute because of the sociopolitical situation in the country. I therefore have the honour to read out the address that he was to have made from this rostrum.
“I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi, President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh ordinary session. I hope that, under his wise leadership, this year’s work will be a complete success. I would also like to commend the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, for his dynamic leadership of the world Organization and his renewed
commitment to the cause of Haiti despite the many challenging problems and other conflicts that affect the world.
“I have the honour today to address this Assembly in the specific context of major challenges that our States repeatedly face, which we must constantly address and find appropriate solutions for the good of humankind. The United Nations, whose mission is to preserve the ideals of international peace and security, is the proper forum in the context of multilateral diplomacy to deal with and overcome those challenges, in accordance with the principles of international law and the values enshrined in its Charter, while respecting the right to self-determination of peoples.
“Global peace and security are at risk. I call on the parties to all the conflicts that are causing disruption and suffering to the citizens of the world to stop the fighting and find negotiated solutions to their differences. There are too many victims, too much destruction, too many consequences for other countries and too much collateral damage. It is imperative to return to respecting the common rules of international law and living together.
“The sharp rise in the cost of basic foodstuffs on the international market is weakening the economies of many countries, especially developing countries, and is pushing hundreds of millions of human beings around the world into instability and food insecurity. The temptation is great for each country to try to monopolize the available resources to provide for its population. We saw the results of such behaviour in the control over vaccines during the coronavirus disease pandemic. In these difficult times, the rule must be solidarity among peoples.
“My country, like many others in the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean and elsewhere, remains highly vulnerable to climate hazards, rising sea levels and increasingly violent and frequent natural disasters. The passage of a single cyclone can wipe out the efforts of decades of hard work and investment. My country has unfortunately experienced devastating earthquakes and cyclones. That is a concern for the countries of the subregion. Within the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), we are looking at this issue.
“It is imperative, indeed urgent, for the international community to demonstrate imagination, selflessness and altruism to commit our planet and our respective countries to a new kind of international relationship. We are all interdependent and the problems of one can quickly have immediate consequences for others. For example, conflicts between two countries or too much poverty in others lead to major migratory movements that can destabilize several neighbouring countries, or even more distant ones.
“In that respect, the theme of the seventy- seventh session of the General Assembly, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, takes on its full meaning in the case of my country. This is an opportunity for me to talk, from the rostrum at the United Nations, about the challenges facing Haiti in the context of an institutional crisis and to speak about my Government’s efforts and responses to address and overcome them.
“I am speaking at a time when my country is going through a multidimensional crisis, whose consequences threaten democracy and the very foundations of the rule of law. It is a sociopolitical crisis, compounded by insecurity, which further exacerbates the country’s situation and undermines the State apparatus. It remains a matter of great concern for my Government and for the international community.
“Haiti is at a crossroads — an extremely difficult, but decisive crossroads for its future. My Government is faced with a rather complex equation that needs to be solved, and that requires the effective support of our partners. My Government’s priorities are to restore security and public order without delay; reach a broader consensus around a political agreement among as many sectors as possible in the short term in order to achieve peaceful governance; create a climate conducive to the holding of general elections as soon as possible, with a view to returning power to elected representatives freely chosen by the Haitian people in order to restore democratic institutions; and address economic and social issues in order to improve the material living conditions of the vast majority of the population.
“On the question of security and the restoration of public order, I will not be telling anyone anything new by saying that the activities of armed gangs create a dangerous environment that is ruining the daily lives of the Haitian population. That is an unacceptable situation, which has reached worrisome dimensions. Clashes among rival gangs have resulted in a high number of victims among the population, forcing them to flee their homes to escape the terror of the bandits.
“In my capacity as Head of the Superior Council of the Haitian National Police, given the complexity of the situation, I took measures to render the police more effective and better prepared to deal with the insecurity. I proceeded, within our means, to strengthen the operational capacities of the police institution and improve the working conditions of police officers. The strengthening of police operations led to some good results, reducing violence by armed gangs, particularly in the metropolitan area. However, much remains to be done to combat and eradicate that scourge.
“That was acknowledged in the Secretary- General’s most recent report (S/2022/481) on the activities of the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH). The report notes that the efforts of the Haitian National Police led to the arrest of several individuals suspected of being involved in kidnappings and murders. The report also recognizes the limitations of the National Police and the lack of capacity and expertise of BINUH, in its current composition, in terms of the number of experts and degree of specialization, to deal with the unprecedented level of crime in the country.
“I want to reaffirm here my determination to put out of action those who want to perpetuate the chaos and prevent the normalization of the situation. My Government, at great sacrifice, made available the necessary resources to provide the National Police with adequate means to effectively carry out its duties. The delivery of armoured vehicles and equipment that it lacks is delayed. I truly regret that the orders placed to better equip the National Police are so late in being delivered. The National Police is capable of doing its job, but it needs strong support from our partners and appropriate training on the ground with the help of partners from the international community in order to put an end to such a situation.
“I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Security Council resolution 2645 (2022), which prohibits the transfer of small arms and light weapons and their ammunition to non-State actors and prevents their trafficking and use for illicit purposes.
“In addition, several Member States have pledged bilateral support to the Haitian National Police, including financial assistance. To that end, a basket fund was set up to assist the National Police in combating gang violence. I commend the Governments that already contributed to that fund, and we encourage other partners to do so. We need their continued solidarity now more than ever. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to our key international partners that made commitments at the various high-level meetings on security in Haiti. I thank them openly on behalf of the Haitian people and Government.
“The circumstances of my accession to the leadership of my country required that I immediately engage in a dialogue with all sectors of Haitian society in order to build sufficient consensus around a political agreement for peaceful and effective governance during the interim period. I am convinced that frank, sincere and inclusive dialogue remains the best formula for achieving a lasting solution to the current crisis.
“Despite the political differences that persist among the political actors, I continue to encourage dialogue. Initiatives involving various segments of society are under way. I hope to see all those efforts succeed in the near future. They primarily concern the restoration of fully operational democratic institutions through free, transparent and inclusive elections, as well as an agreement on a collective approach to constitutional reform.
“With regard to the political dialogue already under way, Haiti is seeking international support to make the process more credible and build confidence among the actors concerned. In that context, I fully support the efforts of the CARICOM and the International Organization of la Francophonie to provide their expertise and engage with us to resolve the crisis, with the discreet yet effective support of the United Nations. The Organization, which has long and extensive experience on the ground in Haiti, must continue to support the political and electoral process, taking into account the realities on the ground and the need to give priority to national solutions.
“I have heard the public’s calls. I have listened to the demands of my compatriots protesting the high cost of living. It is a constitutional right to protest and make demands in a peaceful manner. However, I strongly condemn the looting and vandalism, as well as the attacks on churches, schools, universities, hospitals, politicians, economic actors, diplomatic missions and international organizations. I also condemn those who ordered, organized and financed it all. Sooner or later, they will have to answer for their crimes — before history and justice.
“The actors in Haiti need to understand that politics must be done differently. That is why I remain available and open to continuing the dialogue with all stakeholders in the country, so that together we can open the path to reconciliation in order to repair the torn social fabric and find a lasting solution to a crisis that is pulling the country towards the abyss. Good governance goes hand in hand with the fight against corruption, smuggling and trafficking of all kinds. My Government has taken steps in that direction. Our budgetary discipline and sound management of public revenues recently led to the establishment of a staff-monitored programme in my country with the help of the International Monetary Fund.
“My Government’s major reform of its customs service is beginning to bear fruit and show results. It has enabled us to enhance monitoring and carry out seizures of weapons, ammunition, counterfeit currency and drugs. In the process, we have seen customs revenues double in record time. Not everyone was happy with that strategy, and we have good reason to believe that the unrest and attempts at destabilization represent the retaliation of fraudsters, whose activity has been reduced considerably.
“The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime—a United Nations programme—has provided us with experts to assist in customs administration throughout the reform. The Office needs more resources in order to be more effective, as well as to contribute to the modernization of our customs system and ensure the sustainability of the reforms under way.
“With regard to justice and human rights, my Government assumed office in a delicate political context, following the heinous and tragic assassination of President Moise on 7 July 2021. Justice must be done to him, his family and the Haitian people. I would like to acknowledge the words of President Gustavo Petro Urrego of Colombia who, not long after his address to the General Assembly from this very rostrum (see A/77/PV.4), apologized to the Haitian people for the involvement of Colombian mercenaries in the murder of President Moise. That is a transnational crime involving the nationals of several countries. Investigating it is difficult and complex. I want to thank all the countries involved for their cooperation.
“Many other crimes and massacres have to date gone unpunished, and murderers are still at large, some of whom have had the audacity to place themselves, weapons in hand, at the head of demonstrations over the past few days. I am also aware of cases of human rights violations against peaceful Haitian citizens, a direct consequence of the climate of insecurity that prevails in the country. Respect for human dignity is the foundation of the fundamental rights of every individual. I am determined to respect, and ensure respect for, international and regional commitments aimed at preserving human rights.
“In that regard, working to end prolonged pretrial detentions, which is a situation to which many detainees awaiting trial are subjected, remains a priority. The fact that it occurs reflects the weakness of our judicial system, which must be reformed. In that regard, I commend the efforts of civil society actors and the personnel of the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti, which continue to promote and contribute to the improved administration of justice in the country.
“Contrary to what some of my opponents have said, I have no desire to stay in power for longer than necessary. My Government’s main focus is to re-establish constitutional order and return the leadership of the country to elected officials who are freely chosen by the Haitian people through free, transparent and inclusive elections. I continue to encourage dialogue aimed at reaching a political agreement on the holding of free presidential, legislative and local elections as soon as the minimum conditions are established.
“It is essential that the elections be held in a climate of security and social calm. That is an essential condition for ensuring the broadest possible participation of people of a voting age, which is the only way to guarantee the legitimacy of newly elected officials and ensure political stability. I have begun discussions with the various stakeholders on the establishment of the body responsible for organizing the elections, and those discussions should be concluded shortly. That body must be able to quickly prepare a timetable for political actors on both the constitutional referendum and the holding of elections. We would greatly appreciate the technical support and expertise of our usual partners in that process, while of course respecting the freedom and sovereignty of Haitians.
“With regard to economic and social issues, I often say that poverty, precariousness and the lack of future prospects for our young people, inter alia, are the root causes of the repeated crises my country is experiencing. It is important that, even in the short time in which my Government has been called upon to assume such responsibilities, we address economic and social issues in order to improve Haitians’ material conditions of existence. A sustainable solution to the phenomenon of insecurity also requires long-term socioeconomic development. There is a direct relationship between the level of crime and the situation of extreme poverty.
“We must also give hope to our young people by creating stable and decent job opportunities so as to offer them alternatives to plan and build their futures without being forced to risk illegal and clandestine travel. Safe and legal migration can be beneficial to countries’ economic development, as stated in the Declaration on Migration and Protection, to which 20 Governments of the region, including Haiti, subscribed on 10 June at the ninth Summit of the Americas.
“In addition to the sociopolitical crisis and the phenomenon of insecurity, natural disasters are a major handicap to Haiti’s development. The most recent earthquake on 14 August 2021 dealt another blow to the national economy. The economy’s poor performance for three consecutive years exposed the country to a serious humanitarian crisis.
“There are 4.9 million people, or 46 per cent of the population, in need of humanitarian assistance this year. With the support of our partners, the Government has been able to assist over 450,000 people in three earthquake-affected areas. Damage and losses caused by the earthquake have been estimated at more than 11 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product. We hope that the promises made by our partners at the international donors’ conference held under the auspices of the United Nations and the Haitian Government in Port-au- Prince in February will be fulfilled.
“Insecurity, political instability and natural disasters have contributed greatly to the poor performance of the country’s economy, which has experienced negative growth for three consecutive years. This non-exhaustive summary of the situation explains the deterioration of the living conditions of the majority of the population, whose social and economic rights are constantly being violated. The Haitian population, especially the vast majority who live in precarious conditions, has the right to a decent life.
“It is true that humanitarian aid has never contributed to a country’s development. We must create the conditions to attract investment. It is the responsibility of my Government to work to improve the situation — we are well aware of that fact, and we are working on it.
“Haiti is at a crossroads, a decisive moment in its history. We are working on transformative solutions to the challenges we face. From this rostrum, I wish to join President Biden, who has a solid understanding of the Haitian crisis, in making a solemn appeal to the international community to stand with Haiti and the Haitian people. I also wish to thank all those Heads of State and Government of our great family of nations who have expressed their concern about the situation in my country and have offered Haiti their support. Much remains to be done to emerge from the crisis and move towards the social and economic progress to which the Haitian people aspire.”"
Honduras,HND,North America,"  9,588,000 ",4435,4.486000061,5.9,75.088,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Digestive Disease,201,2.10,"  8,936,659 ",93.21,6.13,"I stand before this global forum at a historic moment for my country, not only because I am the first woman to have the honour of leading our Central American nation, but also because I represent its first democratically elected Government after 13 years of dictatorship; a 2009 coup d’etat fraught with cruel assassinations and death squads; two rounds of electoral fraud; a pandemic and two hurricanes.
It is impossible to understand the Honduran people and our huge caravans of migrants without acknowledging the cruel suffering that we have had to endure. But electoral democracy will not be enough to achieve full material and spiritual well-being for our people, after 13 years of dictatorship under the tutelage of the international community multiplied our country’s public debt sixfold and pushed our poverty rate to 74 per cent, the highest in the history of Honduras. Five out of 10 of my compatriots live in extreme poverty.
However, it is clear to me that none of those figures will shock anyone in today’s world, where we live under a monetary dictatorship, where the poorest are subjected to draconian fiscal discipline measures that increase the neglected majorities’ suffering and where speculative capital knows no limits. It is clear that for our country to survive today, we must reject the presumed austerity that rewards those who concentrate wealth in the hands of a few as inequality increases exponentially.
Since we took office, at the end of January, we have been relentless in seeking consensus and always firmly determined to reach agreements on our compromises without denying them in any way. But attempts to undermine the will of the people are coming at us from every direction, with conspiracies being fomented between the same sectors that plundered the country and their allies in the coup, emboldened by a blatant anti-democratic attitude often disguised as diplomacy. The public policies endorsed by the international financial community’s rentier model over the past 13 years dragged us into a world of violence and poverty characterized by failed and abandoned projects, corruption, looting and drug trafficking.
The international witnesses to the electoral fraud that took place in 2013 and 2017 were well aware of what they were condemning our people to, and yet they were complacent about the worst scourge ever to plague our country. The arrogance of capital and narrow self- interest led many to opt for deceit, while organized crime drove the country into darkness.
The poor nations of the world will no longer tolerate coups d’etat, the use of so-called lawfare or colour revolutions, which are usually aimed at plundering our wealth of natural resources. The industrialized nations of the world are responsible for the serious deterioration of the environment, yet we are the ones they are forcing to pay for their expensive lifestyles. They stop at nothing to drag us into their schemes and plunge us into an endless crisis, pretending that their hands are tied.
The Honduras that I lead is being built based on a vision of a humanist refoundation imbued with dignity and sovereignty. We will take the necessary legal steps to help our environment to recover and share the common good with our entire population. That is why we find the current arbitrary world order to be unacceptable. It perpetuates the existence of third- and fourth-class countries, while those who believe themselves to be civilized never tire of invasions, wars and financial speculation, crucifying us with their inflation time and again. I am here on this rostrum to demand that they respect us. We want to live in peace. Do not keep trying to destabilize Honduras, dictate measures to us or decide with whom we should or should not have relations.
The people are sovereign. They showed that on 28 November with their support for my victory, the biggest in the history of my country. On 15 September, our day of independence, the resistance that fought against the dictatorship imposed during the past 13 years supported me en masse in the streets, fighting off public threats and refusing to allow our national assets to continue being handed over to the highest bidder as if we were a no man’s land.
Never again will we be branded with the stereotype of banana republic. We will end the monopolies and oligopolies that only impoverish our economy. As a generous people who have shed their blood in defence of our forests and rivers, we will not forget that during the dictatorship hundreds of young people were murdered, including our comrade Berta Caceres. Nor
will we forget the forced disappearances of Hondurans for their attitudes and beliefs, including our five Garifuna comrades who have now been missing for two years. Every inch of the homeland that was usurped in the name of the sacrosanct free market, the Zones for Economic Development and Employment and other privileged regimes was watered with the blood of our indigenous peoples.
My social and democratic Government will restore a State of justice and the rule of law so that all of that will never happen again. We are working hard to prioritize incentives and eliminate tax abuses. We have already begun to promote laws on energy as a public good, ensuring workers’ rights and supporting our internal market by investing in agriculture for food security and subsidizing our country’s poorest, who will no longer pay for electric power. We have proposed the renegotiation of free trade agreements. We have taken a sovereign decision to invest in our own development by replacing imports while competing in international markets without subsidizing the excesses of developed nations.
We will recognize the importance of women, who have been denied inclusion in development for centuries, as an integral part of the backbone of society. We will provide them, as well as our children and young people, with health care, quality education, security and food sovereignty.
For Honduras, each wave of migrants that fled the dictatorship that was in place for more than a decade represented a painful loss for their families and for our country as a whole. The numbers tell us that the exodus provoked by neoliberal injustices only generates more unemployment and shackles us to a deplorable dependency. Paradoxically, those who emigrate from our country generate more foreign- currency income than many of our traditional exports. We express our solidarity with and support for those known as tepesianos.
In Honduras, we cannot continue to sustain the hypocrisy of a system that judges crimes linked to drug trafficking, a crime that it has nevertheless supported and facilitated for more than a decade, including through two rounds of electoral fraud and crimes against the nation and millions of Hondurans. For all of those reasons, we will establish an international commission to combat corruption and impunity with the support of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
Honduras will have a future only if it takes firm steps to dismantle the neoliberal economic dictatorship. That is why we have already initiated the refoundation of our country and education system with the ideals and values of our national hero, Jose Francisco Morazan Quezada. My Government has begun a process of refoundation and profound change based on four fundamental pillars — first, a revolutionary transformation of education, raising the human spirit and ending colonialism; secondly, building an alternative and profoundly sovereign economic model; thirdly, building a system with the promotion of humanism, solidarity, integration with our brother peoples, peace and respect for human rights at its core; and fourthly, the progressive nationalization of public services such as health care, drinking water, electricity and the Internet.
Today, as war is once again punishing the world’s poorest and our countries are invaded, we call for a return to respect for the self-determination of peoples and a rejection of the abominable and brutal blockade of the people of our sister republic of Cuba. It is time to seriously discuss the multipolarity of the world. President Barack Obama took the first steps towards ending that infamy. And as the President of Colombia, Mr. Gustavo Petro, has already stated, the aggression against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela must end.
As our comrade Berta Caceres said, the people of the world must wake up. We still have time."
India,IND,Asia,"  1,352,642,048 ",5961,3.523000002,3.8,69.416,Cardiovascular Disease,Chronic Respiratory Disease,Neoplasm,173347,12.82,"  1,339,115,628 ",99.00,7.10,"I bring to you the greetings of more than 1.3 billion people from the world’s largest democracy. They join me in congratulating President Csaba Korosi on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session. They follow closely developments at the United Nations, reflecting the increasingly globalized nature of our existence.
We meet at a challenging time for the world order. This session’s theme, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, seeks to capture its seriousness.
The year 2022 is an important milestone in India’s journey towards growth, development and prosperity. India is celebrating 75 years of its independence, what we call “Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav”. The story of that period has been one of the toil, determination, innovation and enterprise of millions of ordinary Indians. They are rejuvenating a society pillaged by centuries of foreign attacks and colonialism, and they are doing so in a democratic framework, whose steady progress is reflected in more authentic voices and grounded leadership.
That new India, under the visionary and dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is a confident and resurgent society. Its agenda for our centenary will be achieved through the five pledges to which we committed ourselves on our independence day.
First, we are resolved to make India a developed country in the next 25 years. For the world, that creates more capacities for global good.
Secondly, we will liberate ourselves from a colonial mindset. Externally, that means reformed multilateralism and more contemporary global governance.
Thirdly, our rich civilizational heritage will be a source of pride and strength. That includes care and concern for the environment, concepts which are so ingrained in our traditional ethos.
Fourthly, we will promote greater unity and solidarity. That expresses a coming-together on global issues, such as terrorism, pandemics and the environment.
And fifthly, we will work to instil a consciousness of duties and responsibilities in both our citizens and the nation.
These five pledges affirm our age-old outlook that sees the world as one family. We believe that national good and global good can be entirely in harmony.
It is this conviction that led us to supply vaccines to over a hundred nations. Similarly, our evacuation operations in humanitarian-assistance and disaster- relief situations have always had room for other nationals in distress. Even as we meet our own development targets, India offers partnerships to our brothers and sisters in Asia, Africa and Latin America, and we do so based on their needs and priorities. Today, that focus is on green growth, better connectivity, digital delivery and accessible health. Our solidarity is not just in words; it is evident in 700 projects across the world.
Even while India contributes to global betterment, we recognize the sharp deterioration in the international landscape. The world is already struggling with challenges of post-pandemic economic recovery. The debt situation of the developing world is precarious. To this are now added the rising costs and shrinking availability of fuel, food and fertilizers. These, along with trade disruptions and diversions, are among the many consequences of the Ukraine conflict.
The Indo-Pacific region also has fresh concerns about its stability and security, and climate events have added an overlay to these mounting anxieties. As we saw in the case of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the South will be most affected, even if the immediate causes are well beyond its geographical location. It is imperative that global conversations recognize this deep unfairness. The inequity of vaccine distribution should not be replicated in other domains.
As the Ukraine conflict continues to rage, we are often asked whose side we are on. And our answer, each time, is straight-forward and honest. India is on the side of peace and will remain firmly there. We are on the side that respects the United Nations Charter and its founding principles. We are on the side that calls for dialogue and diplomacy as the only way out of conflict. We are on the side of those struggling to make ends meet, even as they stare at escalating costs of food, fuel and fertilizers. It is therefore in our collective interest to work constructively, both within the United Nations and outside it, to find an early resolution to this conflict.
While global attention has been on Ukraine, India has also had to contend with other challenges, especially in its own neighbourhood. Some of them may be aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing conflicts, but they also speak to a deeper malaise. The accumulation of debt in fragile economies is of particular concern. We believe that in such times, the international community must rise above narrow national agendas.
For its part, India is taking exceptional measures in exceptional times. We do so when we send 50,000 metric tons of wheat and multiple tranches of medicines and vaccines to Afghanistan; when we extend credits of $3.8 billion to Sri Lanka for fuel, essential commodities and trade settlement; when we supply 10,000 metric tons of food aid and vaccine shipments to Myanmar; when we fill the gap in humanitarian needs left unaddressed by political complexity. Whether it is disaster response or humanitarian assistance, India has stood strong, contributing particularly to those nearest to us.
The world as we have known it is poised for transformational changes. It has been affected in recent times by a succession of shocks, each of them significant. The COVID-19 pandemic called into question the overcentralized nature of globalization and has led all of us to seek greater resilience in and reliability of supply chains. The repercussions of the ongoing Ukraine conflict have further heightened economic stresses, especially on food and energy. Climate events have added to the disruption that the world is already facing.
As for the promise of technology, it has certainly multiplied our capabilities but also added to vulnerabilities. Trust and transparency are legitimate expectations of a more digitized world. The quest to create a better global order would necessarily have to address all these issues. Among them, some are clearly more existential in nature and necessitate intense coordination by the international community.
Climate action and climate justice are particularly noteworthy in this respect. Working towards them, India has collaborated with partners on the International Solar Alliance, the One Sun, One World, One Grid initiative and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. We stand ready to support any collective and equitable endeavour to protect our environment and further global wellness. “Lifestyle for environment” or “LiFE”, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared on the sidelines of the twenty-sixth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 26) in Glasgow, is our homage to Mother Nature.
India remains deeply committed to fighting climate change under the Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. We do so based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances. We have announced our updated nationally determined contributions after COP 26.
India’s steadfast commitment to South-South cooperation is by now well established and well recognized. Our approach is based on principles of mutual respect and national ownership, with a commitment to sustainable development for all. As we begin the Group of 20 (G-20) presidency this December, we are sensitive to the challenges faced by developing countries. India will work with other G-20 members to address serious issues of debt, economic growth, food and energy security and particularly, the environment. The reform of governance of multilateral financial institutions will continue to be one of our core priorities.
India will be completing its term as an elected member of the Security Council this year. In our term, we have acted as a bridge on some serious but divisive issues confronting the Council. We have also focused on such concerns as maritime security, peacekeeping and counter-terrorism. Our contributions range from providing technology with a human touch to ensuring the safety and security of United Nations peacekeepers.
As the Chair of the Counter-Terrorism Committee this year, India will be hosting its special meeting in Mumbai and New Delhi. I invite all States Members of the United Nations to participate in it.
We need to create a global architecture that responds to the new tech tools deployed against open, diverse and pluralistic societies. Having borne the brunt of cross-border terrorism for decades, India firmly advocates a zero-tolerance approach. In our view, there is no justification for any act of terrorism, regardless of motivation. And no rhetoric, however sanctimonious, can ever cover up blood stains.
The United Nations responds to terrorism by sanctioning its perpetrators. Those who politicize the Security Council sanctions regime under resolution 1267 (1999), sometimes even to the extent of defending proclaimed terrorists, do so at their own peril. Believe me, they advance neither their own interests nor, indeed, their reputation. India has always espoused a cooperative, inclusive and consultative approach to international relations.
We believe that multipolarity, rebalancing, fair globalization and reformed multilateralism cannot be kept in abeyance. The call for reformed multilateralism — with reforms of the Security Council at its core — enjoys considerable support among United Nations Members. It does so because of the widespread recognition that the current architecture is anachronistic and ineffective. It is also perceived as deeply unfair, denying entire continents and regions a voice in a forum that deliberates on their future.
India is prepared to take up greater responsibilities. But it seeks, at the same time, to ensure that the injustice faced by the global South is decisively addressed. We call for serious and sincere negotiations on this critical matter. They must not be blocked by procedural tactics. Naysayers cannot hold the intergovernmental negotiations process hostage in perpetuity.
In these turbulent times, it is essential that the world listen to more voices of reason and experience more acts of goodwill. India is willing and able on both counts. We believe that this is not an era of war or conflict. On the contrary, it is a time for development and cooperation.
In the past, the Assembly has served as a meeting point of views and a catalyst for action. It is vital that we continue to believe in the promise of diplomacy and the need for international cooperation. Let us therefore strive to return to the course of seeking peace, progress and prosperity."
Indonesia,IDN,Asia,"  267,671,008 ",10511,4.179999828,5.3,71.509,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Digestive Disease,6544,2.44,"  259,507,034 ",96.95,7.83,"Many leaders have spoken here over the past few days. We share the same concerns. The current state of our world is very worrying. The pandemic persists and the global economy remains sluggish. War among nations is no longer a mere possibility but has become a reality. The violation of international law has become a norm in pursuit of narrow self-interest. Crisis after crisis is unfolding around the world, including climate change, rising inflation food and energy shortages.
History teaches us that these phenomena might lead to a huge war. Let us look at the period leading up to the Second World War. The Great Depression, the rise of ultranationalism competition over resources and rivalry between major Powers — these are very similar to what we are facing today.
Clearly, we have been handling these challenges the wrong way. We have been divided instead of united. We have been working individually instead of collectively. We have been focusing on words instead of deeds. The question now is: What are we going to do about it? Are we going to continue along the same path or are we going to choose a different path? If we continue on the same path, we will be heading towards a disaster, but if we choose a different path, we might stand a chance.
So, today I would like to offer a world order based on a new paradigm — a paradigm of win-win, not of zero sum; a paradigm of engagement, not of containment; a paradigm of collaboration, not of competition. This is the transformative solution that we need. Allow me to share why we need this new paradigm.
First, we must reignite the spirit of peace. A deficit of trust breeds hatred and fear and may lead to conflict. We have witnessed these phenomena in many parts of the world. We must turn the trust deficit into strategic trust, and that starts with upholding respect for international law The fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable. I repeat — the fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable. Those principles must always be upheld.
Meanwhile, the peaceful solution is the only option for settling any conflict. A habit of dialogue and cooperation would nurture strategic trust. These are the rules of the game that we must maintain if we truly want peace. It is our responsibility to apply them consistently, not selectively or only when we see fit. My President conveyed these messages of peace in his visits to Kyiv and Moscow in June.
We must also apply this new paradigm to make a breakthrough in Palestine and Afghanistan. For far too long, the people of Palestine have suffered and longed for peace. Until Palestine can truly become an independent State, Indonesia will stand firm in solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and sisters. The people of Afghanistan also deserve a peaceful and prosperous life where the rights of all, including women, are equally respected and where women’s and girls’ access to education is granted. Without that new paradigm, peace will remain an elusive dream.
Secondly, we must revive our responsibility for global recovery. We are concerned that global solidarity is fading away, whereas injustice and selfishness abound, the weak stand small and the mighty take all. We are seeing the symptoms every day. Trade discrimination is running rampant. The monopoly in the global supply chain persists. Global economic governance is used to justify the rules of the strong.
The pandemic teaches us the valuable lesson that no one is safe until everyone is. That lesson shapes the priorities of Indonesia’s presidency of the Group of 20 (G-20). The whole world is pinning its hope on G-20 as a catalyst of global economic recovery, especially for developing countries. The G-20 must not fail We cannot let global recovery fall to the mercy of geopolitics. We must act urgently to address food and energy crises and prevent a fertilizer crisis from happening. Otherwise, billions more people will be at risk particularly in developing countries.
We also need a new paradigm as we move beyond the recovery. A new paradigm would instil a collective responsibility to attain the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and fight climate change. Without that new paradigm, there will not be a strong recovery for all and many of us will be left behind.
Thirdly, we must bolster regional partnership. In many places, the post-war regional architecture was built as a tool for containment and alienation. That phenomenon continues today with mini-lateral groupings. Many become part of a proxy war between major Powers. That is not what regional architecture should be. It must serve as the building block for peace and stability, rather than undermine them.
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was built exactly for this purpose. We refuse to be a pawn in a new Cold War. Instead, we actively promote the paradigm of collaboration with all countries.
That paradigm will also guide Indonesia’s chairmanship of ASEAN next year. It is the commitment of Indonesia to forge ASEAN’s centrality in shaping regional order in the Indo-Pacific, to reinforce ASEAN’s unity as a locomotive for peace, stability, and prosperity in the region, and to ensure that ASEAN matters to our peoples, to the region and to the world.
ASEAN will also continue to address seriously the situation in Myanmar. Indonesia is deeply concerned by the military junta’s lack of commitment to implementing the five-point consensus. ASEAN must move forward and not be taken hostage by the situation in Myanmar. The support of the international community, in particular the neighbouring countries of Myanmar, is very important to restoring democracy in Myanmar.
On the Pacific, Indonesia will continue to strengthen our cooperation with the Pacific countries. We will work together to address our shared challenges, including on climate change. As a Pacific nation ourself, we want to see the Pacific as an integral part of a peaceful, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific.
The new paradigm of collaboration must be the spirit of the United Nations. Inclusive and meaningful engagement must trump the take-it-or-leave-it approach, and the voices of all countries big and small, developed and developing, matter equally. That is the very foundation of multilateralism. That is why we need a strong and reformed United Nations. It is why we need a renewed multilateralism that is fit for purpose and fit for its time. That is why we need a multilateralism that delivers. I repeat — we need a multilateralism that delivers.
I believe that by working together and adopting a new paradigm, we can create a better world for all. It is no longer the time to talk the talk; ow is the time to walk the talk."

All of the hopes and aspirations of humankind are built on justice. Humans have the capacity to create a framework of all-encompassing justice, which means eliminating injustice. The Islamic Republic of Iran defends the fight against injustice in all of its forms — against humankind, against spirituality, against the Almighty and against the people of the world — wherever it appears.
The desire to be closer to the Creator and the Creator’s teachings exists in all humankind, and we have witnessed a willingness to change in revolutions throughout the history of humankind. Although many movements have never matured into revolution and many revolutions have deviated from their original path, the success of many people and nations, such as the nation of Iran in realizing its aspiration for an Islamic revolution, has strengthened such aspirations in the hearts of people around the world. The Islamic revolution of Iran was the result of Iranians’ drive for justice and fairness. Despite the many conspiracies that Iran has faced over the decades, it has been able to safeguard itself. As a first step, and based on an advanced social and organizational order, the Islamic Republic of Iran was created in order to ensure justice internally and bring to the world a message of justice and fairness. Spirituality and multilateralism were key components in that path.
I am grateful and honoured to be the representative of a people and a nation who are the inheritors of a great civilization that has been free for millennia and has always managed to defeat the plots of the enemies who sought to conquer it — a nation that has always seen oppression as an existential enemy and has always fought to eradicate enslavement, from the Babylonians all the way to the Palestinians. We believe in a common fate for humankind, and we support universal justice. What we seek for ourselves, we wish for others, and what we do not wish for ourselves, we do not impose on others. The nation of Iran believes that justice leads to unity and cohesion and warfare leads to destruction. A country that wants to have justice within its own territory, but then creates or trains terrorist groups and unleashes them on other nations outside its borders should be ashamed before humankind and ashamed in the face of the principles of freedom, justice and fairness. Humanity does not belong only to certain parts of the world.
The Islamic Republic of Iran, drawing inspiration from its Constitution and the spiritual values on which it is based, sees the protection of human rights as one of the most effective ways to ensure and contribute to the protection of the rights of all oppressed people across the globe and considers it one of its inherent duties. The Islamic Republic of Iran rejects the double standards of some Governments vis-a-vis human rights and sees them as a major factor rendering the subject of human rights banal in the eyes of many. In Iran there has been much discussion of the death of dozens of innocent women in a Western country, and as long as there are such double standards, where attention is focused solely on one party rather than on all of us, equally, we will not have true justice and fairness.
Human rights belong to everyone, but they are unfortunately trampled on by many Governments, as was shown by the recent discovery in a Canadian school of mass graves containing the bodies of hundreds of children of the native tribes of Canada and as is evidenced with regard to the rights of the Palestinians, the right to life of people whose lands are occupied, those who have fallen victim to terrorism and those who seek freedom and refuge only to see their children locked up in cages. All of that shows that who is accused and who the accuser must not be judged solely based on the representations of some. The right to claim to be protectors of human rights needs to be founded on something, which many lack these days. With regard to the savagery and crimes of Da’esh, which enslaved Christian, Yazidi and other religious minorities, women and children, it has been clear from our attempts to combat them that we have been defenders of human rights and that those who defended and promoted Da’esh are on the side of the accused.
Today we are witnessing a change in the world order away from a unilateral world, a hegemonic world, a world in which financial power controls the standards of behaviour, a world where criminal and oppressive sanctions are imposed on nations and international organizations are used as tools of oppression in exerting pressure on defenceless nations, in other words, a world completely lacking in justice and fairness. Support for that order among the world’s peoples and nations has been lost. A new order has taken shape and will undoubtedly be realized. From Lebanon to the occupied territories of Palestine and across our region we see the defeated policies of that outdated system. We see terrorism, we see native cultures and religions trampled on, we see unilateral actions and unjust opposition to multilateralism. All of that has created great obstacles to human progress.
We firmly believe that in order to address both old challenges and new contexts, we have no choice but to choose a path of cohesiveness and unity, on a basis of multilateralism, justice, shared human values and divine teachings. There is no other path. We believe that the hearts of all freedom-seeking nations are wedded to those deep-seated values, and their defence against oppressors throughout the world rests on our shoulders. What we are seeking are the rights of the Iranian people and nation. We will not tolerate any relationship based on oppression. We will stand firm and proudly defend our rights. We believe that any oppression is an act against peace and stability, which is a threat to the entire world.
Achieving global security through any path other than justice cannot be sustainable or lasting. That is therefore precisely what we expect the United Nations to support and pursue. Of course, implementing justice and fairness is enormously challenging and difficult, and perhaps it is for that reason that many who claim to be on the side of peace run away from the responsibilities of peace. To them we say, “If you do not wish to shoulder the burden, do you not even wish to shoulder the burden of fighting oppression?”
Our belief is deeply rooted in the Qur’anic culture, which instructs us to oppress no one, and the fate of many nations is dependent on exactly those principles. When we consider nations that flee the logic of character, fairness and justice and run towards unilateralism and oppressive power; nations that lack reason and rely on coups d’etat, military interventionism and boots on the ground; nations that fight terrorism and many other injustices selectively or nations that use nuclear weapons, we can ask if that brought the world closer to fairness, justice and peace or did it rather become a basis for hegemony. What human value has the killing
of hundreds of thousands of Yemeni, Iraqi, Syrian and Afghan children served? Were those not the evil faces of the total lack of justice and fairness in many parts of the world? And in reality, what is it that the Islamic Republic of Iran seeks that has caused havoc and chaos among the oppressors of the world? Is it not the exercise of its own logical and just right?
A willingness to support hegemony has become a sore point for humankind around the world and poses a serious threat. Increasingly, nations around the world wish to achieve justice and independence while also enjoying security. The realization of the doctrine of resistance shows how sincerely and deeply many people wish to achieve true justice, while unilateralism has been used to hold many countries back on a selective basis. The United States cannot accept that certain countries have the right to stand on their own two feet, and it continues to confuse militarism with security. The situation of America’s allies is no better. What is occurring today in Europe is a mirror image of what has occurred in Western Asia over the past few decades. The conduct and the result of moving troops throughout those regions have yielded the same results, and the fate of many countries has shown that America has pursued its own interests at the expense of many others.
The Islamic revolution in Iran was the beginning of the push of the great nation of Iran to seek its own place in the world. For decades we have confronted foreign plots such as coups d’etat, oppressive sanctions and hegemonic interventions. None of Iran’s successes have been acceptable to the great Powers. Some 40 years ago, the late President of the Islamic revolution Mohammad-Ali Rajai placed his feet, whose soles had been savagely tortured, upon a rostrum in the Security Council Chamber and showed the scars of the torture he had been subjected to at the hands of the Shah’s secret police (see S/PV.2251 (1980)). He was later martyred by the hypocrites. A decade later, the late Imam Khomeini ensured that Iran was able to repel foreign aggression against its territory and take charge of its own destiny. The people of Iran who were themselves victims of terrorism have today become supporters who can be counted on in the fight against terrorism throughout the region.
The Islamic Republic of Iran has spent much capital to achieve its objectives — from the time when Saddam Hussein tore up the Algiers Agreement and attacked our country unprovoked, to the time when the American Government trampled on the nuclear agreement and, we saw a new phase of crimes committed against humankind. Some time ago, the former President of the United States announced that it was the United States that created Da’esh. For us, it makes no difference which American Administration created Da’esh. What matters is that a Government on the other side of the planet decided to bring havoc and chaos to our region at the expense of the lives and blood of women and children and innocents. Nonetheless, the Islamic Republic resistance put an end to that destructive movement. And the leader who emerged in the fight against terrorism was none other than our beloved late martyr Qasem Soleimani — a seeker after freedom who became a martyr on the path to obtaining freedom for the nations of our region. And the previous President of the United States of America effectively signed off on that savage, illegal and immoral crime. What he said essentially showed that the oppression that was imposed on the nations of the region had managed to heal some of the hearts that were broken by that crime.
We will not waver in our pursuit of justice in the face of the crime that the American President admitted to having signed off on. We will pursue justice through a fair tribunal for those who martyred our beloved General Qasem Soleimani.
The history of Iran is the history of a nation that has learned to stand on its own two feet and not to depend on anyone else. Iran learned that lesson when in both world wars it declared its neutrality, yet in both wars was subject to foreign occupation. Afterwards, when it approached the United States in the 1950s and relied on it to achieve Iran’s dream of nationalizing its oil industry, it was betrayed again. Even the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was signed and accepted in the framework of the Security Council, was unilaterally trampled on.
Iran has learned the policy of resistance and progress, which it has focused on pursuing because of an advanced and logical social order through which the Islamic Republic of Iran today, despite the oppressive sanctions imposed on it, has become a strong country and has achieved many impressive goals in the fields of technology, know-how and expertise. We believe that the world today needs a strong Iran that is able to export other products in addition to oil and gas.
We have distribution networks throughout our vast nation in electricity, knowledge-seeking, biosciences, nanotechnology and nuclear sciences. We are at the cutting edge, and Iran’s growth in those sectors is considerable. A good example of our social endeavours was when we sought to bring universal health-care coverage to 85 million people, which showed that the pursuit of the will of the people is a foundation of the system of the Islamic Republic of Iran. In contrast, during the times of the imposed war of Iraq against Iran, we were even prevented from being able to purchase barbed wire, but today we have been able to manufacture, through our own know-how and capabilities, the most modern systems to defend our nation.
Our enemies did not retreat, rather our nation managed to drive all of its enemies out of the arena by participating in an impressive and unprecedented fashion in the Islamic revolution in order to strengthen the values of faith and divine will, as well as the policy of good-neighbourly relations. Progress in economic and trade relations have now been brought to the forefront of the Islamic Republic’s foreign policy.
We would like to have extensive relations with all nations throughout the world, particularly with our neighbours. War is not the solution to crises. Dialogue, conversations and negotiations are the true solutions.
The Islamic Republic of Iran, as a powerful country in the region, has a visible presence and is willing to solve crises. During the past few years, Iran’s trade in its region increased at an impressive rate. We have now entered with our neighbours into a new era of the expansion of friendly, neighbourly and brotherly ties, which brings stability and security to all sides.
During the hard times of our neighbouring countries, we showed that we were their true friends. During the numerous conversations I have had with regional leaders, one of the main points raised was that regional security must be born from within and not from the outside. The way to realize that is through collaboration and cooperation, not by forming opposing blocs. We must rely on brotherly and friendly relations. If we leave nations and the regions in charge of their own destinies, then the occupiers will leave and neighbours will remain supportive of one another in eternity.
In the not-too-distant past, we saw the fires of war burning between the two brotherly nations of Iraq and Iran, because of the encouragement of enemy Powers throughout the world. Today we see the Arba’een pilgrimage in observation of the fortieth day of the martyrdom of Imam Hussain, which is celebrated in order to renew our faith in those values and to respect the descendants of the Prophet, who gave their lives for human dignity and human values.
I would like to direct the General Assembly’s attention to one of the most egregious points that shows the oppressive Powers present in the region. The region has not previously had such an occupying Power as savage as the Zionist regime. The killing of women and children is recorded in the dark report card of the Zionist regime, which has managed to build the biggest prison in the world in Gaza. The illegal expansion of settlements and housing on Palestinian territories and farms and the killing of their children and their new generations shows everyone that seven decades of Israeli occupation and brutality are still with us and not coming to an end.
But the global Powers must show why they keep running away and evading the solutions proposed by the Islamic Republic of Iran to resolve the Palestinian crisis. The entire Palestinian territory, from the mountains to the sea, needs only one solution — allowing the votes of all Palestinians, including Muslims, Christians and Jews, in a comprehensive referendum. The occupying Zionist Power, which has occupied Jerusalem and occupies other lands in the region, cannot be a partner for security and stability.
Allow me to draw Assembly members’ attention to another example of the lack of justice and fairness, namely, the double standards used when speaking of the nuclear science capacities of the Islamic Republic of Iran. And we all know that it is for only human and peaceful endeavours, but some countries are keen on portraying that as a threat in order to sweep under the rug what they should rightly face themselves, namely, denuclearization.
As the leader of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, I announce that the Islamic Republic of Iran is not seeking to build or obtain nuclear weapons, and such weapons have no place in our doctrine. That has been issued as an official fatwa announced by His Eminence Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, and a Sharia- based fatwa issued by His Eminence is worth more than any measures with any outside or international agencies.
All of this is taking place in an environment where countries that seek to portray us, unjustly, as a threat keep pursuing nuclear-weapon development and testing and have made a gift of those weapons of mass destruction to the Zionist Government. In doing so, the Governments that must be disarmed are rewarded, but those that are observing proper frameworks are even threatened by measures under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. And despite the fact that it accounts for only 2 per cent of nuclear activities worldwide, Iran has been the subject of 35 per cent of nuclear inspections.
I therefore ask all those here today to please listen carefully to the following points.
First, the Islamic Republic of Iran, in good faith, accepted an agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in 2015 and lived up to all of its commitments, without exception, in the first phase, but the result was America trampling upon that agreement. As they themselves said, in so many words, there were unprecedented oppressive sanctions measures imposed on the people of Iran as punishment for being freedom seekers. A weapon of mass destruction — that is what sanctions are. And abiding by, or cooperating in, the implementation of the same is helping oppression take root.
Secondly, it was America that trampled upon and left the agreement, not Iran. The International Atomic Energy Agency issued 15 different reports stating specifically that Iran had fully complied with all of its commitments.
Thirdly, while we have paid the price for having lived up to our commitments, Iran has not been given the opportunity to reap the rewards and rights of the agreement, due to the United States, in cooperation with Europe, trampling upon that agreement.
We gave ample opportunities for those who trampled upon and left the agreement to return to it. We have been extremely flexible, and had it not been for our flexibility, the negotiations would have stopped in the very first few days. Iran’s logic of negotiations is a just analysis of what is going on, and our wish is only one thing — that commitments be honoured.
Guarantees, it seems, are simply things that might happen. We are basing that on lived experience. We are speaking of the experience of America having left the JCPOA. And we negotiated with the current American Government for a year and a half for it to renew its commitment to return to the agreement and fulfil its provisions.
Today, even as the American Government speaks of honouring their commitments to this deal, it keeps repeating the same old stories of the past, which casts serious doubt on its true commitment to return to the agreement. That brings us to another challenge. Can we truly trust, without guarantees or assurances, that the American Government will live up to their commitment this time?
Of course, the Islamic Republic of Iran, with various well-established and vast relationships with countries across the globe, has managed in many cases to neutralize the sanctions and to create new opportunities. The United States Government itself has announced many times through various Government officials that the maximum-pressure policy has suffered an embarrassing defeat. We have found our path, independent of any agreement, and we will continue steadfastly on that path.
At the same time, while we are very earnest in the negotiations and have shown that if the rights of the people of Iran are respected, there is a great and serious will to resolve all issues, we believe that the knot of the nuclear deal must be loosened from the same place where they managed to tie it.
I will conclude by expressing the need felt around the world for justice and fairness. Every single human being must be a part of actively building a new world based on justice and human values. If we wish the new world to be acceptable, righteous, powerful and successful in resolving the challenges facing humankind, then it must be based in global fairness and justice. That requires following several principles.
First, throughout the world, we must feel collectively responsible and determined to fight against oppression.
Secondly, we must respect the wishes and will of the people and of nations and must refrain from direct engagement in their internal affairs.
Thirdly, we must eliminate double standards.
Fourthly, we must stand up to violence and war.
Fifthly, international organizations must act independently and prudently.
Finally, and most important, we must create roles for dignified and qualified humans with experience so that they can create that new system. Our views on the future horizon are very realistic. On the basis of divine promises, as delivered by the prophets, we firmly believe that justice will envelop the world, and those who are true followers of divine commands will be blessed by the reappearance of the last messiah."
Ireland,IRL,Europe,"  4,819,000 ",55653,6.399000168,7.0,82.103,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,470,9.75,"  4,819,000 ",100.00,11.59,"This year Ireland marks the centenary of its independence. The Irish Free State was established on 6 December 1922, when we began our journey as an independent sovereign nation. From the start of that journey, we were a nation that looked outwards. One of our first acts was to apply to join the League of Nations. The following year, in his first address to the Assembly of the League of Nations, the then President of the Irish Government’s Executive Council, W. T. Cosgrave, spoke of Ireland’s desire to “avert the ancient evils of warfare and oppression; to encourage wholesome, and to discourage unwholesome relations between nation and nation; to enable even the weakest of nations to live their own lives and make their own proper contribution to the good of all, free even from the shadow and the fear of external violence, vicious penetration or injurious pressure of any kind”.
Those are the ideals that guide Ireland’s foreign policy. Those same principles, articulated 100 years ago by the League’s newest member, continue to inform our actions today — the belief that all countries have an equal right to live in peace; that all countries, no matter how small, have a contribution to make to international peace and security and to economic and social development; and that all people have the right to live in dignity and to have their human rights and fundamental freedoms respected.
One hundred years later, we as a global community are very far from living up to those principles. We are convening here at a time of crisis, when we are yet again facing the threat of widespread global hunger and food insecurity; when we see daily the devastating impacts of climate change, with those who bear no responsibility for its causes being most affected; when we have witnessed the most blatant disregard for international law and for the Charter of the United Nations on my own home continent of Europe; and when much of the progress that we were making towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals has stalled or gone into reverse as we grapple with the continuing effects of the coronavirus disease pandemic.
It does not have to be this way. We have the tools and the systems to address those issues. In the General Assembly and the other organs, institutions and agencies that make up the United Nations, we have the spaces to discuss, negotiate, share experiences and craft solutions. We have an interlocking web of charters, treaties, norms, resolutions, international jurisprudence, political declarations and agreed conclusions. Our global structures are not perfect. We know that. No structures ever are. There is much that needs reform. But it is not our systems or our structures, our treaties or charters, that are fundamentally failing us. It is the lack of political will to implement and uphold them.
I began my statement by quoting a former Irish Leader speaking to the League of Nations Assembly, almost 100 years ago. Let me quote another Irish leader and former President of Ireland, Eamon de Valera, also speaking to the League of Nations, exactly 90 years ago today. De Valera believed in the League’s potential to protect small nations through collective security. But he recognized that in order to be effective, the League’s Covenant had to be enforced and Member States had to fulfil their obligations. In his speech in September 1932, he warned that world opinion was losing faith in the League’s capacity to protect peace and stability. He said,
“People are complaining that the League is devoting its activity to matters of secondary or very minor importance, while the vital international problems of the day ... are being shelved or postponed or ignored”.
Ninety years on, we cannot continue to shelve, postpone or ignore our existential global challenges.
As an elected member of the Security Council, Ireland has seen first-hand that political will and a commitment to the principles of the Charter can deliver results. On Syria, Ireland has worked in partnership with Norway, and with all Council members, to ensure that humanitarian aid can continue to reach the millions who need it. During our 18 months on the Council, we have twice renewed the United Nations cross-border operations, which provide crucial aid to 4 million people in the north-west of the country. Ireland will continue to work to keep that critical lifeline open. We urge other members of the Council to support their further renewal. To do otherwise would have devastating consequences for the people of Syria.
We have worked with our partners on the Council to extend and renew the mandates of the 14 United Nations peacekeeping operations and the many United Nations special political missions that require the Council’s approval. Day after day, across the globe, the military and civilian personnel in those missions protect civilians, monitor ceasefires, support peacebuilding, facilitate negotiations and verify the implementation of peace agreements. Among them are hundreds of Irish men and women, who carry on our proud tradition of peacekeeping and crisis management. We are deeply proud of their service. In an echo of that tradition last year, Ireland led work on Security Council resolution 2594 (2021), the Council’s first-ever resolution on peacekeeping transitions. Adopted with the support of all Council members, it will help to ensure that the hard- won gains of peace are maintained when a peacekeeping mission ends. It puts the protection of civilians at the centre of United Nations planning for transitioning from military peacekeeping operations into civilian-led political missions in countries emerging from conflict.
We have also seen progress on the women and peace and security agenda. As co-Chair, together with Mexico, of the Informal Expert Group on Women and Peace and Security, Ireland has ensured that the role of women as peacebuilders and agents of change is at the heart of United Nations peacekeeping and political missions across the globe. We have brought the voices of grass-roots women peacebuilders to the Council table, with a record 16 women civil-society briefers during our presidency of the Council in September. Our commitment to the protection of civilians has also informed our work in leading negotiations earlier this year to agree on a political declaration on the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. The declaration is a significant milestone that recognizes the humanitarian consequences of the use of explosive weapons in populated areas and includes a number of ambitious actions to address them. I look forward to its formal adoption at a high-level international conference in Dublin on 18 November.
We have been encouraged by those successes, incremental though some of them are. But at times we have also been deeply frustrated by the Security Council’s failure to act. A year ago I stood before the Assembly (see A/76/PV.13) and spoke of our ambition for the Council to adopt a resolution on climate and security. Together with the Niger, we worked tirelessly to craft a draft resolution in the Council that reflected the reality that climate change is increasingly driving insecurity and acting as a threat multiplier. We challenged the Council to take on its responsibility to address the impact of climate change on international peace and security, and 113 countries — 113 members of the Assembly — supported us in our efforts. One country — Russia — vetoed those efforts.
It frankly beggars belief that in 2022, the United Nations organ charged with the maintenance of peace and security has still not accepted its responsibilities in this area. It is a singular failure of political will and political responsibility. A year ago, I also spoke to the Assembly about Ireland’s deep concern about the situation in Tigray, in northern Ethiopia, the looming humanitarian catastrophe there and the violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. I spoke of the vital need for a negotiated ceasefire, unfettered humanitarian access, the restoration of basic services and a political solution to the crisis. Yet a year later, we continue to raise the alarm. We continue to urge the Council to act decisively. We continue with our determination to support a political solution and seek accountability for gross human rights abuses.
Every month, the Security Council meets to discuss the situation in Palestine. Every month, Ireland, together with many of our fellow members of the Council, has reiterated its firm commitment to a two-State solution, with a viable Palestinian State based on the 1967 borders, living in peace and security alongside the State of Israel, with Jerusalem as the capital of both States. But we are no nearer today to that aim than we were when we joined the Council 18 months ago — and, truth be told, long before that. Israel’s settlement building continues — knowingly and deliberately, it would seem — to undermine the viability and territorial contiguity of a future Palestinian State and to jeopardize the possibility of a two-State solution. Settlements are a clear violation of international law and today stand in the way of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace. We should be clear that the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory is untenable. We cannot and must not become inured to it. We cannot tolerate a situation where young Palestinian people have no confidence in political progress and no hope for the future. The very real risk is that the space for the political middle ground is being squeezed out, further lessening the prospects of a just and lasting solution. The international community must renew its efforts. Progress will not be possible without addressing the root causes of the conflict. The Security Council must fulfil its responsibilities. Crucially, it must work for compliance with its own resolutions.
With regard to Afghanistan, since the Taliban takeover of Kabul Ireland has resolutely defended the human rights of the Afghan people, particularly women and girls, and we have increased our humanitarian aid. We helped to ensure that the mandate for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, adopted in March through Security Council resolution 2626 (2022), was directly informed by the courageous activism of Afghan women. And we have pushed for accountability for the Taliban’s actions. But we continue to witness the ongoing erosion of the rights of Afghan citizens, particularly women and girls, as well as those of ethnic and religious minorities and the LGBTQI+ community. September is a month when many students around the world return to school. For girls in Afghanistan, there is no return. They have now been out of school for more than a year. That is a clear violation of their fundamental rights and freedoms. Their potential
will not be fulfilled and that of Afghanistan will be weakened if the situation continues to prevail.
At this time of heightened nuclear threat, it is deeply regrettable that one country alone—Russia—prevented an agreement from being reached at the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons last month. The heightened nuclear risks arising from Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and the threats to nuclear safety and security resulting from military activity in and near civilian nuclear facilities in Ukraine are unprecedented. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons must remain an essential element of international peace and security. The urgency of its full implementation cannot be overstated.
In the past few days, many of my colleagues in this Hall have spoken of Russia’s illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine. For European Member States in particular it carries dark echoes of our continent’s past. We face an expansionist Power brutally invading and occupying a peaceful neighbour. While we in Europe faced that many times in the twentieth century, we did not think we would face it again in the twenty-first. But this is not just a European issue or a concern for the West. All States, and particularly small countries such as my own, should fear a world where might equals right, where the strong can bully the weak, where sovereignty and territorial integrity can be blatantly violated and where the Charter that all of us in the Assembly have faithfully put our trust in can be flouted with impunity.
In Ukraine in July, I heard first-hand accounts from civilians of the brutality and violence visited on men, women and children by the occupying Russian forces. Where Russia’s forces have been pushed back, we have seen the wanton destruction and the uncovering of mass civilian graves such as in Bucha and, more recently, Izyum. We have seen the targeting of nuclear facilities and of civilian infrastructure. And now we see President Putin’s planned sham referendums in eastern Ukraine, aimed at forcibly changing its borders, in clear violation of the Charter. We have to name what we are seeing. Those actions, taken collectively, show Russia behaving like a rogue State.
We are also seeing how the impact of Russia’s aggression reaches far beyond Ukrainian or European shores and borders. From the Horn of Africa to the Sahel and beyond, food insecurity has reached a critical tipping point. Some of the countries that have been the worst affected by the current food-insecurity crisis are those most reliant on imports of wheat from Russia and Ukraine. Combined with the impact of climate change, conflict, severe drought and other extreme weather events, we are facing a crisis that requires urgent action. Like many others represented in this Hall, Ireland has responded by increasing its humanitarian aid. That has included direct humanitarian support of €78 million for the Horn of Africa and sustained and early funding to other severely affected countries and regions, including Yemen, Afghanistan and the Sahel.
Yesterday, together with the United States, UNICEF and others, Ireland led a pledging event at which we committed an additional €50 million over three years specifically to tackle acute child malnutrition. We have also increased our core funding to the Central Emergency Response Fund in recognition of the critical importance of enabling United Nations agencies to respond rapidly as crises unfold. We have prioritized gender responsiveness in our humanitarian work, addressing the particular vulnerabilities faced by women, girls and boys in emergency settings. And we have adapted our funding and our programming so that we respond to humanitarian emergencies in a way that underpins our climate, development and peacebuilding interventions and builds the resilience of individuals, families and communities.
The link between conflict and food insecurity is irrefutable. That is why we focused on hunger and conflict as a priority for our term on the Security Council. Conflict is now the main driver of hunger, reversing some of the gains made during recent decades. We are failing in the challenge to reach zero hunger. Ireland’s long-standing commitment to food security will guide our international cooperation for many years to come. Ending world hunger and ensuring the right to food must be placed firmly at the top of the political agenda. At major summits over the past 12 months on food systems and nutrition for growth and at the European Union-African Union Summit, Ireland has committed to helping partner countries on their journey towards sustainable, resilient and nutritious food systems. That transformation is more urgent now than ever.
At the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change later this year, we will be at the forefront of efforts to combat the existential threat of climate change. Adaptation to climate change and its effects will remain a key focus of our international engagement and support. We must make progress on averting,
minimizing and addressing losses and damages that are a direct result of our changing climate.
On global health, Ireland has strongly supported the work of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria since its inception 20 years ago. This week we announced a significant new contribution of €65 million over three years — a 30 per cent increase over our previous such contribution — to support their important work against those diseases, as well as the related strengthening of health systems.
The United Nations and the rules-based international order are central to who we are as a nation. But multilateralism can succeed only if it is effective, and it can be effective only if we, the Member States, allow it to be so. That takes courage, political will and commitment to collective solutions to global challenges. It takes a readiness to compromise, and it takes a genuine belief in the principles of the Charter. When, in 100 years’ time, a future Irish leader marks the bicentenary of Ireland’s independence and returns to this Hall, I hope that he or she will be making a very different speech — one that celebrates substantive, sustained progress in ending conflict and tackling global inequality, poverty and hunger; one that will not cite frustrations over the use of the veto in the Security Council to thwart the will of a majority of Member States, because the veto will be an anachronism that has long ceased to exist; one that refers to a strengthened and reformed United Nations system, structured and equipped to tackle the challenges of its day; one that remarks on the common will to uphold the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and that looks back with relief at the collective action that brought this planet back from the brink of catastrophic collapse."
Israel,ISR,Asia,"  8,382,000 ",32494,4.21999979,6.9,82.819,Neoplasm,Cardiovascular Disease,Dementia,454,5.42,"  8,382,000 ",100.00,10.59,"In November 1947, the General Assembly gathered and decided on the creation of a Jewish State. Only a few hundred thousand Jews lived in Israel at the time, in hostile surroundings, shocked and devastated after the Holocaust, in which 6 million of our people were murdered. Seventy-five years later, Israel is a strong, liberal democracy, proud and prosperous. It is the start-up nation that invented Waze and Iron Dome, medicines for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s and a robot that can perform spinal surgery, as well as a world leader in water and food technology, cyberdefence and renewable energy, with 13 Nobel prize winners in literature, chemistry, economics and peace.
How did this happen? It happened because we decided not to be a victim. We chose not to dwell on the pain of the past but, rather, to focus on the hope of the future. We chose to invest our energies in building a nation and a happy society that is optimistic and creative. We did not only reach the promised land, but we are building the promised land. History is determined by people. We need to understand, respect and learn from history, but we also need to be willing and able to change it, to choose the future over the past, peace over war, partnership over seclusion and isolation.
A few months ago, we convened the historic Negev summit. We sat at dinner, not far from the grave of David Ben-Gurion, the founding father of the State of Israel. There were six of us — the Secretary of State of the United States and the Foreign Ministers of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Israel — at a dinner that only two years ago, no one would have believed was possible. Then the door opened, and someone came in and said, “I’m sorry to disturb you, but there was a terror attack not far from Tel Aviv. Two Israelis were murdered.” In an instant, we all understood that the goal of the attack was to destroy the summit, create anger among us, cause us to argue and divide this new partnership among us.
I said to the foreign ministers, “We have to condemn this terror attack, right now, together. We have to show the world that terror will not triumph.” The room fell silent. Then one of the Arab foreign ministers said, “We are always against terror, that is why we are here.” Five minutes later, we put out a joint statement from the six of us, condemning the attack and sanctifying life, cooperation and our belief that there is a different way. The summit continued, agreements were signed and working groups were formed to deal with issues of technology, food security, energy, water, education and infrastructure. Those working groups are changing the face of the Middle East as we speak.
The people of the Middle East — of the entire world — should look around and ask themselves: who is doing better? Those who chose the path of peace or those who chose the way of war? Those who chose to invest in their people and country or those who chose to invest in the destruction of others? Those who believe in education, tolerance and technology or those who believe in bigotry and violence?
Whenever I meet someone who is critical of Israel, I always have the same answer: come and visit us, come and meet the real Israel. You will fall in love with a country that combines breath-taking innovation with a deep sense of history. It has great people, great food, great spirit. It is a vibrant democracy and a country in which Jews, Muslims and Christians live together with full civic equality. In the Government that I lead, there are Arab ministers. There is an Arab party that is a member of our coalition. We have Arab judges on our Supreme Court and Arab doctors saving lives in our hospitals. Israeli Arabs are not our enemies, they
are our partners in life. Come and visit us. You will discover that Israel is an incredible cultural mosaic, from the white snowy mountains of the Golan to the white desert sand of the Negev, from Tel Aviv, the high- tech capital and non-stop party on the Mediterranean Sea, to Jerusalem, our eternal capital, the holy city for three religions, in whose beautiful streets the past meets the future every single day.
There are, however, two major threats hanging over the head of our wonderful country. Those threats also hang over the heads of the members of this Assembly, even though they may try to deny it. The first is the nuclear threat — the fear that terrorist States and terrorist organizations will get their hands on nuclear weapons. The second threat is the demise of truth. Our democracies are slowly being poisoned by lies and fake news. Reckless politicians, totalitarian States and radical organizations are undermining our perception of reality.
We should know. There is no country in the world that faces this phenomenon more than Israel. There is no country that has come under greater attack from lies, with such a vast amount of money and effort being invested in spreading disinformation about it. Last May, the picture of Malak al-Tanani, a 3-year-old Palestinian girl, was published all over the world, with the terrible news that she was killed with her parents in an attack by the Israeli Air Force. It was a heart-breaking image, but Malak al-Tanani does not exist. The photo was taken from Instagram and is of a girl from Russia. I can give thousands more examples of similar fake news about Israel. The anti-Israel movement has been spreading these lies for years in the media, on college campuses and on social media. The question is not why they do it, but why the members of this Assembly are willing to listen. Why are they listening to people who have invested billions of dollars in distorting the truth? Why do they side with Islamic extremists who hang gay people from cranes, oppress women and fire rockets at civilians from kindergartens and hospitals?
I am not a guest in this building. Israel is a proud sovereign nation and an equal member of the United Nations. We will not be silent when those who wish to harm us use this very stage to spread lies about us. Antisemitism is the willingness to believe the worst about the Jews, without question. Antisemitism is to judge Israel by a different standard than any other country.
Conducting this orchestra of hate is Iran. For more than 40 years now, in the town squares and on the streets of Iran, demonstrators have been photographed burning Israeli and American flags. The members of this Assembly should ask themselves: where are the flags are coming from? How did they get so many of our flags? The answer is that they are manufacturing them specially, just so they can burn them. This is what an industry of hate looks like. This is a regime that systematically deals in hatred. It even hates its own people. Young Iranians are suffering and struggling under the shackles of Iran’s regime, and the world is silent. They cry for help on social media and pay for their desire to live a life of freedom with their lives. Iran’s regime hates Jews, women, gay people and the West. They hate and kill Muslims who think differently, like Salman Rushdie and Mahsa Amini. Their hate is a way of life. It is a way to preserve their oppressive rule. There is only one Member State of the United Nations that openly states its wish to destroy another Member State. Iran has declared time and time again that it is interested in the total destruction of the State of Israel. And this building is silent. What are Member States afraid of? Has there ever been a time in human history when silence stopped violence?
The country that wants to destroy us is also the country that founded the largest terrorist organization in the world, Hizbullah. Iran funds Hamas and Islamic Jihad and is behind mass terrorist attacks, from Bulgaria to Buenos Aires. It is a murderous dictatorship that is making every effort to obtain a nuclear weapon. If the Iranian regime obtains a nuclear weapon, they will use it.
The only way to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon is to put a credible military threat on the table and then, and only then, to negotiate a longer, stronger deal with them. It needs to be made clear to Iran that if it advances its nuclear programme, the world will not respond with words but with military force. Every time a threat like that has been put on the table in the past, Iran stopped and retreated.
Today the world is choosing the easy option. It chooses not to believe the worst despite all the evidence to the contrary. Israel does not have that privilege. This time, we are not standing empty-handed against those who want to destroy us. The Jews today have a State; we have an army and great friendships, first and foremost with the United States. We have capabilities and are not afraid to use them. We will do whatever it
takes. Iran will not get a nuclear weapon. We will not stand by while there are those who try to kill us. Not again. Never again.
Israel’s economic and military strength enables us to protect ourselves, but it also enables us to strive for peace with the entire Arab world and with our closest neighbours, the Palestinians. An agreement with the Palestinians, based on two States for two peoples, is the right thing for Israel’s security and economy and for the future of our children. Peace is not a compromise. It is the most courageous decision we can make. Peace is not weakness. It embodies within it the entire might of human spirit. War is surrender to all that is bad within us. Peace is the victory of all that is good.
Despite all the obstacles, a large majority of Israelis still support the vision of the two-State solution. I am one of them. We have only one condition: that a future Palestinian State will be a peaceful one, that it will not become another terror base from which to threaten the well-being and very existence of Israel, that we will have the ability to protect the security of all the citizens of Israel at all times. If anyone believes that this demand is too much, they should look at the neighbourhood in which we live. They should look at Lebanon, a collapsing State controlled by Hizbullah; at Syria, where a murderous regime massacred half a million of its own people; at Afghanistan, Libya and Iran. We can be asked to live according to the values of the United Nations Charter, but we cannot be asked to die for them. My father was a child in the ghetto, and my grandfather was murdered in a concentration camp. We want to live in peace, but only if it gives us security, not if it threatens us even more.
Look at Gaza. Israel did everything the world asked of us, including from this very stage. We left. Seventeen years ago, we dismantled the settlements and took apart our military bases. There is not a single Israeli soldier in Gaza. We even left them 3,000 greenhouses so they could start to build an economy for themselves. What did they do in response? In less than a year, Hamas, a murderous terror organization, came to power. They destroyed the greenhouses and replaced them with terrorist training camps and rocket launch sites. Since we left Gaza, over 20,000 rockets and missiles have been fired at Israel — all of them at civilians, all of them at our children.
I have a child with special needs. Her name is Yaeli; she is autistic and does not speak. In May last year, I had to wake her at three o’clock in the morning and run down with her to the bomb shelter because missiles were exploding above our home. All those who preach about the importance of peace are welcome to try running to a bomb shelter at 3 a.m. with a girl who does not speak, try explaining to her, without words, why there are those who want to kill her.
We have been asked more than once in this building why we do not lift the restrictions on Gaza. We are ready to do that tomorrow morning. We are ready to do more than that. I say from here to the people of Gaza that we are ready to help them build a better life and an economy. We have presented a comprehensive plan to help rebuild Gaza. We only have one condition, that they stop firing rockets and missiles at our children. If they put down their weapons, there will be no restrictions. If they put down their weapons and let us bring home our children who are being held in captivity — Hadar and Oron, may their memory be a blessing; Avera and Hisham, who are still alive — we will build their economy together. We can build their future together, both in Gaza and in the West Bank. If they put down their weapons and prove that Hamas and Islamic Jihad are not going to take over the Palestinian State that they want to create. If they put down their weapons, there will be peace.
That is the minimum I owe my grandfather, my father and my daughter. The Jewish people have learned the lessons of the past. Our security is guaranteed by our military might, economic ingenuity and democratic resilience. Israel seeks peace with all our neighbours. We are not going anywhere. The Middle East is our home, and we are here to stay forever. We call upon every Muslim country, from Saudi Arabia to Indonesia, to recognize that and to come talk to us. Our hand is outstretched for peace.
Conflicts do not disappear on their own. Hostility does not disappear on its own. People create conflicts; people can also replace them with friendship, kindness and common good.
The burden of proof is not on us. We have already proved our desire for peace. Our peace treaty with Egypt has been fully implemented for 43 years now, and our peace treaty with Jordan for 28 years. We are a country that keeps its word and fulfils its agreements. We have proved our desire for peace through the Abraham Accords, the Negev summit and the agreements we have signed with the Arab world.
In the Book of Numbers, there is a verse that every Jew is familiar with: “May the Lord raise His countenance towards you and grant you peace” (Numbers 6:26). The State of Israel is the only country in the world founded by a book — the Book of Books, the Tanach. That book and the principles of liberal democracy require us to stretch out our hand in peace. Our history requires us to be clear-eyed and very careful. That is how we have made peace in the past; that is how we will make peace in the future."
Italy,ITA,Europe,"  60,627,000 ",34989,11.21000004,6.5,83.352,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,4042,6.67,"  60,627,000 ",100.00,10.45,"It is a great honour for me to be here today. The General Assembly is the place where the world opens up to dialogue and discussion, which are essential elements for peaceful coexistence among countries. As stated in the second preambular paragraph of the 1945 Charter of the United Nations, the objective of the United Nations is “to maintain international peace and security [and] promote the economic and social progress of all peoples”.
Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and the ensuing food, energy and economic crises are putting our collective ideals at risk in a way that has rarely happened since the end of the Cold War. Those crises stand alongside the other great challenges of our time — climate change, the coronavirus disease pandemic and inequality — and amplify their costs, especially for the most vulnerable.
Accountability for the conflict is clear and one-sided. It is our collective responsibility to find answers to those problems with urgency, determination and effectiveness. We cannot let ourselves be divided into North and South. We must act together and rediscover the value of multilateralism that is celebrated here in this Hall. The invasion of Ukraine violates the values and rules on which international security and civil coexistence among countries have rested for decades. We thought that we would no longer have to witness wars of aggression in Europe. Imperial ambitions, militarism and systematic violations of civil and human rights seemed to belong to the past century.
Since February, however, we have witnessed the bombing of theatres, schools and hospitals. We have seen terrible attacks and violence against civilians, even children. We have witnessed an attempt to subjugate a free and sovereign democracy, which has fought back with pride and courage to defend its independence and its dignity.
Helping Ukraine to protect itself was not only the right choice to make; it was the only choice consistent with the ideals of justice and fraternity that underpin the Charter of the United Nations and the resolutions adopted by the Assembly since the beginning of the conflict.
Italy acted without delay alongside the other States members of the European Union (EU), its NATO and Group of Seven allies and all partners that, like us, believe in a rules-based international system and multilateralism. Together, we have responded to President Zelenskyy’s request for aid because a military invasion planned months in advance and carried out on multiple fronts cannot be stopped with words alone. We have imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia to weaken its military apparatus and to convince President Putin to take a seat at the negotiating table. We have welcomed thousands of refugees and assisted those who remain in Ukraine. We also stand ready to fund the country’s reconstruction.
The horrors of war are best answered with the warmth of solidarity. Moscow’s plan was to conquer Kyiv in a few weeks. Ukrainian soldiers thwarted that attempt and forced Russia into a longer and more difficult conflict, thanks also, in part, to our military assistance. In the past few weeks, a heroic counteroffensive has allowed Ukraine to recover thousands of square kilometres of territory, starting with Kharkiv, and forced the Russian army to retreat. The outcome of the conflict remains unpredictable, but Kyiv appears to have gained an important strategic advantage.
The sanctions we imposed on Moscow have had a disruptive effect on Russia’s war machine and on its economy. Russia is struggling to make the armaments it needs on its own, as it is finding it difficult to buy the materials required to produce them. The International Monetary Fund expects the Russian economy to contract both this year and the next by approximately 10 per cent in total, compared to the 5 per cent growth estimated before the war. The impact of those measures is likely to grow over time, partly because some will take effect only in the coming months. With a weaker economy, it will be more difficult for Russia to respond effectively to the defeats that are piling up on the battlefield.
The unity of the European Union and its allies has been instrumental in providing Ukraine with the support it needs and in imposing harsh costs on Russia. Moscow immediately tried to divide our countries by using gas as a means of blackmail.
Italy reacted promptly, diversifying its gas suppliers and accelerating the production of renewable energy. To date, we have halved our dependence on Russian gas and expect to become completely independent in 2024. On that path, we benefited from agreements made with many African countries, from Algeria to Angola to the Republic of the Congo. We want to develop green technologies together in order to place Africa squarely at the centre of the green transition. The war in Ukraine has redrawn energy geography and, with it, geopolitics. The European Union is set to look increasingly to the South and Italy can be a bridge to the southern shore of the Mediterranean and to the entire African continent.
Social cohesion is essential to maintaining a united, resolute position consistent with our values. The rising cost of energy is undermining economic recovery, limiting the purchasing power of households and damaging the productive capacity of businesses, and it could sap our country’s commitment to Ukraine.
In Italy, we have spent approximately 3.5 per cent of our gross domestic product to help businesses and citizens cope with rising inflation. We now need to do more, especially at the European level. As Italy has long argued, the European Union must impose a price cap on gas imports, which will also help us further reduce our payments to Russia. The EU must support its member States while they support Kyiv and use the strength of its institutions to shield its neighbours from Russian claims.
In many countries, the war of aggression in Ukraine has awakened or strengthened the desire for a united Europe. The Italian Government has long championed Ukraine’s bid for EU membership and strongly supports the integration of the Western Balkans, Moldova and Georgia into the European Union.
We can emerge from crises only by looking to the future with courage and ambition. Our goal is peace, and that peace must be deemed acceptable to Ukraine if it is to be lasting and sustainable. So far, Russia has not shown that it wants an end to the conflict. The referendums for independence in the Donbas constitute a further violation of international law that we firmly condemn.
Nonetheless, Italy wishes to be at the forefront of efforts to try and reach an agreement as soon as that becomes possible. We have managed to do so in the past, when we highlighted how the blockade of Black Sea ports posed a threat to global food security. The agreement on Ukrainian grain exports marked an important moment of cooperation between the parties, for which I want to thank the United Nations, Secretary- General Guterres and Tiirkiye.
It is our hope that we will be able to find other ways of cooperating, starting with the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. Allowing a team of experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency access to the plants was a step forward. Now, it is essential that we arrive at some form of demilitarization of the area. We cannot risk a nuclear catastrophe.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has produced consequences that go far beyond Europe’s borders. Rising energy prices have hit the poorest the hardest, exacerbating poverty and inequality. Rising food prices and the scarce availability of grain and other cereals have had the hardest impact on the poorest countries. Reduced gas supplies have forced some countries to reopen coal-fired power plants or postpone their closure, albeit for a period strictly related to the emergency.
We must respond to such an attack on our peaceful coexistence with multilateralism, in a spirit of solidarity and responsibility. We must respond to the war of aggression by reaffirming the principles underpinning the General Assembly, namely, respect for human rights, international cooperation and non-belligerence.
In his address to the General Assembly in 1988, Mikhail Gorbachev noted how, in a globalized world, the use or threat of force could no longer and must no longer be an instrument of foreign policy (see A/43/ PV.72). Efforts to solve global problems, Gorbachev said, require a new scope and quality of interaction of States. Our reaction to the war in Ukraine serves to reaffirm the fact that gratuitous violence should have no place in the twenty-first century.
Italy hopes that there can be a future in which Russia returns to the principles to which it chose to subscribe in 1945. A world divided into blocs and characterized by rigid ideological demarcations and military confrontations cannot generate development or solve problems. We must maintain our individual identities while conducting international relations responsibly, legally and peacefully. That principle must apply to all the crises we face, from Ukraine to the recent clashes in the Caucasus; from the instability in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America to the tensions in the Indo-Pacific.
Despite the divisions of recent months, we have a solid foundation on which to build. Italy’s presidency of the Group of 20 (G-20) last year coincided with a moment of great cooperation among countries. It is a legacy that we must not dissipate. In that regard, I recall Rome’s readiness to host World Expo 2030 in order to continue to offer shared solutions to global problems.
At the most acute stage of the pandemic, we took action to overcome protectionism in medical supplies and ensure more vaccines for the world’s poorest regions. Through the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility mechanism, we distributed more than 1.4 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to the countries that needed them the most. We enhanced financial assistance to vulnerable States to help them respond to the economic consequences of the pandemic and we promoted the extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative.
Through a newfound spirit of cooperation, we intensified the fight against climate change. For the first time, all G-20 member States pledged to try to keep global warming to within 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and accepted the scientific facts behind that goal. We also agreed on a set of short- and medium-term responses to achieve that goal. The commitments that we made at the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Glasgow followed shortly thereafter.
At the G-20 Summit, we set out new financial contributions to help low-income countries transition to a more sustainable economy. We must continue to support the most vulnerable States in order to help them defend themselves against the impacts of climate change and to pursue their own transition paths. I refer here, for example, to the tragic flooding in Pakistan, where a large part of the country is under water and millions of people have been forced to leave their homes. The environmental crisis affects us all and we must all come out of it together.
Italy’s commitment to peace and international solidarity is unceasing. We are the largest contributor of Blue Helmets among European countries, and our military is deployed across five missions in the Mediterranean, Africa and Asia. We participate in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon with the second-largest contingent.
We are very active in promoting dialogue with all countries in the wider Mediterranean. In Libya, we are committed to ensuring that the difficult process of national reconciliation receives strong support from the international community. On that journey, the United Nations remains our main point of reference.
I also want to thank United Nations institutions for the valuable humanitarian aid they provide for the management of migration in the Mediterranean. Italy is well aware that migration is a global phenomenon and must be addressed as such. We must take a responsible, humane and shared approach.
The war in Ukraine and the resulting crises have strained the cohesion of the international community, but it is precisely in that context that we need to rediscover the spirit of cooperation that has, in the past, enabled us to face similar challenges together. Our common institutions must renew themselves. Italy strongly supports the need to reform the Security Council to make it more representative, efficient and transparent.
In the coming years, Italy will continue to be a protagonist in the EU and stand close to its NATO allies, ready to listen, open to dialogue and determined to contribute to international peace and security. Those are the same principles and goals that inspire the United Nations and that we must defend urgently today."
Japan,JPN,Asia,"  127,202,000 ",36452,2.829999924,5.8,84.47,Neoplasm,Cardiovascular Disease,Dementia,19466,15.30,"  127,202,000 ",100.00,11.74,"We stand at a historic watershed moment. Seventy-seven years have passed since the establishment of the United Nations, yet we are still witnessing devastation in Ukraine and around the world. What would the founders of the United Nations, who were determined not to repeat the scourge of the world wars, think if they saw the challenges to the international order that we are facing?
We have all gathered here at the General Assembly because we stand with the fundamental vision and principles of the Charter of the United Nations — to realize an international community in which Member States unite to maintain peace and security and all people can enjoy economic and social development. Is that not what we are aiming for?
It is imperative to maintain an international order in which the rule of law is firmly established. The United Nations has played a central role in the development of such an international order. However, today we see its foundations being gravely shaken. Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is an act that tramples on the vision and principles of the Charter. It is crucial for all countries to be under the rule of law, not the rule of force. We absolutely cannot allow that.
The United Nations does not exist solely for the benefit of the great Powers. It exists for the entire international community, founded on the principle of the sovereign equality of all Member States. It exists to fulfil the claims of not just the powerful and loud States but also of the voices that often go unheard but are equally legitimate. And it is especially relevant at a time when the existing international order is being
tested around the world. Now is the time to return to the vision and principles of the Charter and to mobilize our strength and wisdom in order to ensure an international order that is based on the rule of law. To that end, we must reform the United Nations and strengthen its functions.
The late Secretary-General Hammarskjold, who was killed in the line of duty while attempting to mediate a ceasefire during the Congo crisis, said that “[i]t is our responsibility to remedy any flaws there may be” in the institutions of the United Nations.” In order to realize the world to which the Charter aspires, we must tackle head-on the strengthening of the functions of our Organization. In order to demonstrate Japan’s strong commitment to the United Nations and to multilateralism, I would hereby like to outline Japan’s commitment to realizing our Organization’s vision.
First, we must reform the United Nations, including the Security Council, in order to return to the vision and principles of the United Nations Charter, with the strengthening of the Organization’s functions, including with regard to disarmament and non-proliferation.
Secondly, we must bring about a United Nations that promotes the rule of law in the international community.
Thirdly, we must promote efforts based on the concept of human security in the new era.
We must face the fact that the credibility of the United Nations is at stake due to the aggression against Ukraine by Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council. We, the States Members of the United Nations, must act to restore this Organization’s credibility.
There are frequent discussions about the dysfunctionality of the Security Council. We have debated that issue for 30 years. But what is truly needed now is not a discussion for the sake of discussion, but actions towards reform. Even among the permanent member States of the Security Council, there are some countries that have shown a willingness to embrace reform.
But there can be no reform without negotiation. The various positions cannot be compromised or converge without any negotiation. The time has come to start text-based negotiations in order to reform the Security Council. The Summit of the Future, in 2024, is an excellent opportunity to broadly review the nature of the United Nations. By all means, let us gather a wide range of wisdom, including from experts, and build momentum.
Faced with the crisis of the international order caused by Russia’s aggression, the General Assembly adopted a resolution condemning Russia in the strongest terms with an overwhelming majority (resolution ES- 11/1). At that time, the United Nations was a beacon in the dark night, clearly indicating the direction in which the international community should go. The General Assembly proved to be the sole universal organ that represents all Member States, pointing us in the direction of the international community’s just cause.
Japan is determined not only to reform the Security Council, but also to work earnestly to further revitalize the General Assembly and to push the United Nations so it can pursue an even greater role in the maintenance of peace and security. Japan will also continue to support the Secretary-General as he oversees the activities of this Organization.
Even threatening to use nuclear weapons, as Russia has done, not to mention actually using them, is a serious threat to the peace and security of the international community and is absolutely unacceptable. As a Prime Minister from Hiroshima, I am immensely dedicated to the realization of a world without nuclear weapons, driven by the sentiments from the hibakusha, the victims of the use of nuclear weapons.
Last month, the sole opposition by Russia blocked the unity and concerted efforts of the international community to reach consensus on an outcome document that would maintain and strengthen the non-proliferation regime, which is the cornerstone of the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime. That caused me great dismay, just as it did for the overwhelming majority of the Member States. However, I refuse to relent, because we are only one country away from adopting the draft final outcome document by consensus. I believe that document represents a new foundation for the international community to proceed with realistic engagements on nuclear disarmament in future. As the only nation to have ever suffered atomic bombings during war, Japan has a unique historical role, and we renew our resolve to realize a world without nuclear weapons. We will continue to make pragmatic efforts to achieve that goal. We must ensure that Nagasaki remains the last place to suffer an atomic bombing.
This is the twentieth year since the Japan-North Korea Pyongyang Declaration, signed by Prime Minister Koizumi and Chairman of the National
Defence Commission Kim Jong II. Japan’s policy remains unchanged. Japan seeks to normalize its relationship with North Korea, in accordance with the Japan-Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Pyongyang Declaration, through comprehensively resolving the outstanding issues of concern, such as the abductions and the nuclear and missile issues, as well as putting the unfortunate past behind us. Japan is prepared to engage in dialogue on matters of mutual concern. I am determined to meet with President Kim Jong Un, without any conditions, and will seize any opportunity and give my all to take diligent action in that regard.
Japan has also made long-term contributions in the field of peacebuilding. Japan first participated in a full-scale peacekeeping mission in Cambodia in 1992. Thirty years later, many Cambodian personnel wearing blue helmets are protecting the peace and future of places such as Mali, the Central African Republic and Lebanon. Then Lieutenant Colonel Teav Chanrithy was one of many deployed to Lebanon after Japan’s peacekeeping training. Since then, he has been active as a peacebuilder, mentoring younger generations at the peacekeeping operations training centre for the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces. The torch of peace created through Japan’s contributions to peacekeeping operations will be borne beyond generations and across borders. Japan supports it.
Japan is fully committed to the realization of a United Nations that promotes the rule of law in the international community. The rule of law is not reserved for one particular State or region. We need to remind ourselves that the rule of law is especially important for vulnerable nations. Strengthening the rule of law based on international law will, in the long run, benefit all States and lead to the sustainable growth and sound development of the international community.
On the basis of that conviction, Japan has been playing an active role in various fields in cooperation with other countries, including efforts towards the realization of a free and open Indo-Pacific.
In 1970, overcoming serious divisions among Member States at the time and with persistent dialogue, the General Assembly adopted resolution 2625 (XXV), entitled “The Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States”, also known as the friendly relations declaration. That Declaration, the fruit of our predecessors’ wisdom, serves as a foundation from which the basic principles for the promotion of the rule of law are drawn.
The following basic principles for States emerge from that Declaration: first, to break away from rule by force and pursue the rule of law through observing international law in good faith; secondly, to not allow any attempts to change the status quo of territories or areas by force or coercion; and thirdly, to cooperate with one another in addressing serious violations of the principles of the United Nations Charter.
We are convinced that those basic principles serve as the basis to hold an increasingly divided international community together while ensuring respect for human rights and achieving sustainable development.
Starting in January, Japan will serve as a non-permanent member of the Security Council. By listening not only to the big voices but also the small voices, we intend to take action to strengthen the rule of law in the international community.
Japan will strengthen efforts based on the concept of human security in the new era. People deserve to enjoy a high-quality life, free from anxiety and fear. The concept of human security has not changed, but now we are standing at a historical watershed moment and facing a new challenge.
Today, in addition to global pandemics, we see the use of force and coercion against other countries, food and energy insecurity, inflation and climate change. These are all interconnected and threaten the safety of people now more than ever, further exacerbating poverty and disease.
The Sustainable Development Goals aim for a society in which no one is left behind, and their achievement requires the realization of human security in the new area. In doing so, the key is to enhance the resilience of individuals, societies and nations to cope with the changes and challenges specific to our times.
Adjumani district, in Uganda, is facing difficult and complicated issues, such as the increasing influx of refugees from neighbouring countries and rising costs due to the situation in Ukraine, which is just one example of the difficult and complex challenges that the world is facing today.
Moini Fred, an administrator from Adjumani, learned through the Japan International Cooperation Agency training how to incorporate the views of both
refugees and his compatriots in running his district. Despite its own economic difficulties, Adjumani district continues to provide administrative services as well as support to refugees, and Mr. Fred is working hard to build a cohesive community free of ethnicity- or nationality-based tensions.
With an unsteady international order and amid growing anxiety, Japan will work with the United Nations in order to realize human security in the new era, including on initiatives through the United Nations Trust Fund for Human Security. In addition, Japan will also continue to invest generously in people.
At the eighth Tokyo International Conference on African Development in August, I announced the investment of $30 billion in Africa as the sum of public and private financial contributions over the next three years, with an emphasis on investment in people. Japan will also focus on human-resource development and capacity-building in other parts of the world. Based on my conviction that education is the foundation of peace, I will serve as an education champion and promote cooperation through human- resource development based on the outcome of the United Nations Transforming Education Summit.
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has also illustrated the importance of human health and efforts to protect people from disease. Japan has provided a total of approximately $5 billion to support the COVID-19 response, including vaccine-related assistance through the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility and other programmes. Japan has also decided to contribute $1.08 billion to the Global Fund over the next three years. Japan will continue to take a leading role in strengthening the global health architecture and achieving universal health coverage in the post-COVID-19 era as we approach next year’s Group of Seven summit, which I will preside over.
Japan is also contributing steadily to the creation of a world where people can enjoy a high-quality life in a safe environment. Our emergency assistance and support to strengthen the resilience of food systems in order to ensure food security, as well as our role in the development of international standards and norms in the field of information and telecommunications through the efforts at the International Telecommunication Union and other organizations, are just a few examples. In order to promote those efforts, Japan will also revise its Development Cooperation Charter, which articulates the basic policy of our development-cooperation policies.
I support the Secretary-General’s leadership in presenting Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) as a response to the current and future challenges facing the international community. As history experiences this dramatic change, Japan will continue to support suffering people around the world under the concept of human security in the new era. Japan will work together with the United Nations and Member States towards the maintenance of peace and stability underpinned by an international order based on the rule of law.
It is precisely because we stand at a watershed moment in history that Japan continues to have strong expectations for the United Nations. Times change, but one thing remains the same: the vision and the principles of the United Nations. With that conviction, I am determined to work with everyone in order to strengthen the United Nations."
Jordan,JOR,Asia,"  9,965,000 ",11748,14.92199993,4.6,74.405,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Neonatal Disorder,165,1.66,"  9,955,035 ",99.90,7.67,"We meet today, in this General Assembly, as the alarm bells ring all around us. Numerous crises batter our world, crises that are increasingly interlocked — regional conflicts with an international impact, devastating climate change, pandemic disruptions, extremist violence, spiralling inflation, looming recession and, for all too many around the world, the growing reality of hunger. Developing countries have been the hardest hit. Is this the future that we will leave to the generations yet to come?
We must deliver a different world, one of expanded horizons, a more equitable world, sustainable economic growth, exciting new opportunities, more and better jobs and the inclusive peace for prosperity, in which all people can thrive.
To reach those goals, our countries must unite behind effective collaborative action. The question now is whether we will have the vision and determination to get the job done.
Let us consider the climate crisis. No country can heal our injured Earth alone. We need global partnerships that can create real change. Jordan is part of those efforts. We have been building strong partnerships to manage and sustain vital water resources, and we see more opportunities to work with partners to preserve precious world heritage sites and natural wonders — the unique Dead Sea, the sacred Jordan River and the resilient coral reefs of the Gulf of Aqaba, all of which are threatened by climate change.
Food security is another global priority. Hundreds of millions of people go to bed hungry, and the numbers are rising. How can parents raise healthy children? How can students learn? How can workers do their best when they are hungry and without hope?
Since the beginning of the pandemic, and now with the crisis in Ukraine, global supply chains have been disrupted. Many well-off countries experienced empty food shelves for the first time in living memory. They are discovering a truth that people in developing countries have known for a long time — for countries to thrive, affordable food must reach every family’s table.
At the global level, that demands collective measures to ensure fair access to affordable food and expedite the movement of staples to countries in need. Sustainable, inclusive economic growth has too often been a victim of global crises, but it can also be a defence that strengthens us to endure the storms. In my region, we expect to build integrated partnerships that tap the capabilities and resources of each of our countries for the benefit of all. We see regional resilience packs coming together to stimulate fresh opportunities and growth. Jordan has established multilateral partnerships with
Egypt, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and other countries in the region to capitalize on those opportunities. Our country is a bridge for regional partnerships and cooperation, international crisis response and humanitarian action.
Jordan has always been a source of regional stability, as well as a refuge for those in need. In that context, let me say a word about refugees and the communities that host them. In 2012, I stood before the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session and spoke for the first time about the Syrian refugee flow and its pressure on Jordan’s scarce resources (see A/61/ PV.7). At that point, 200,000 Syrians had sought refuge in our small country. Today, 10 years later, we host more than 1.3 million. Meeting the needs of those and other refugees is an international responsibility, and host countries look to the international community to honour its commitments.
For decades, the Middle East has been synonymous with conflict and crisis. But we are hopeful that a new-found spirit of collaboration can make our region an exemplar of resilience and integration. While politics may sometimes fail our world, one absolute remains — always put people first. To keep hope alive for all peoples means rising above politics to ensure every individual’s prosperity. Such efforts will be fruitless if they are exclusionary. Inclusion of the Palestinian people in regional economic projects should be an integral part of our efforts.
In the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, peace continues to be elusive. Neither war nor diplomacy has held the answer to that historic tragedy. It is the people themselves, not politics and politicians, who will have to come together and push their leaders to resolve it. What would our world look like now if the conflict had been settled long ago, if walls had never gone up and if people had been allowed to build bridges of cooperation instead? What if extremists had never been able to exploit the injustices of occupation? How many generations of young people could have grown up in the optimism of peace and progress?
As we continue our efforts to achieve peace, we must not abandon refugees. This year, the General Assembly will vote on renewing the mandate of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. The international community should send a strong message of support for the rights of Palestinian refugees, ensuring that Palestinian refugee
 children have schools to go to and access to appropriate medical care.
A founding principle of the United Nations is the right to self-determination for all peoples. The Palestinian people, with their resilient national identity, cannot be denied that right. The road forward is the two-State solution, in accordance with United Nations resolutions — a sovereign, viable and independent Palestinian State based on the 4 June 1967 lines, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living side by side with Israel in peace, security and prosperity.
Today the future of Jerusalem is an urgent concern. The city is holy to billions of Muslims, Christians and Jews around the world. Undermining Jerusalem’s legal and historical status quo triggers global tensions and deepens religious divides. The holy city must not be a place for hatred and division.
As custodians of Jerusalem’s Muslim and Christian holy sites, we are committed to protecting their historical and legal status quo and to their safety and future. As a Muslim leader, let me clearly say that we are committed to defending the rights, the precious heritage and the historic identity of the Christian people of our region. Nowhere is that more important than in Jerusalem.
Today Christianity in the holy city is under fire. The rights of churches in Jerusalem are threatened. That cannot continue. Christianity is vital to the past and present of our region and the holy land. It must remain an integral part of our future.
We can weather the most serious crises if we join together. Let us here in this General Assembly honour our shared interest in a brighter future, a future of dignity and hope, that brings new opportunities for all our peoples. But let us not ignore the alarm bells ringing around us. We must act.

Kazakhstan,KAZ,Asia,"  18,320,000 ",23399,4.900000095,6.0,73.236,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Digestive Disease,3259,17.79,"  18,320,000 ",100.00,9.13,"First of all, I congratulate Mr. Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.
We meet here at United Nations Headquarters at a critical time for humankind. The world of today appears to have entered a new, increasingly bitter period of geopolitical confrontation. The long-standing international system, based on order and responsibility, is giving way to a new, more chaotic and unpredictable one. The global system of checks and balances has failed to maintain peace and stability. The security architecture is eroding. Mutual distrust among global Powers is dangerously deepening. The world is falling prey to a new set of military conflicts. For the first time in two generations, we face the prospect of the use of nuclear weapons, and not even as a last resort. New fault lines are creating artificial barriers and economic isolation. Economic and political sanctions have become a new norm that erodes the supply chains that ensure food security, threatening millions, especially in vulnerable communities. These problems contribute to the mounting challenges of soaring inflation, job loss and fears of a worldwide recession, especially for developing nations. Finally, these crises severely hamper the urgent action we all agreed to take to combat climate change and enhance sustainable development.
Some 77 years ago, the founding Members placed within the Charter of the United Nations the principles and norms of international law that have successfully guided us ever since. There is nothing more important now than to return to the foundational principles that lie at the root of this universal Organization. In particular, we must rethink the linkages between three primordial principles: the sovereign equality of States, the territorial integrity of States and peaceful coexistence among States. These three principles are interdependent. To respect one is to respect the other two. To undermine one is to undermine the other two. When the global disarmament regime — both conventional and nuclear — is weakened, those three principles are threatened.
Conversely, as those three principles are respected, they grow in strength. Together, they become the basis for greater inter-State cooperation at every level: subregional, regional and global. This is the global prosperity dividend. That system of values, embodied in the United Nations, remains a beacon of hope for millions of people in different parts of our planet. We must staunchly defend these values, the United Nations as its core and the spirit of cooperation that underpins it. In other words, we cannot simply shrug our shoulders and agree to polarization and division.
We cannot afford indecision or narrow interests, which are detrimental to that common heritage and our collective good. Too much is at stake. Therefore, Kazakhstan stands ready to cooperate with all relevant actors in a spirit of inclusiveness, multilateralism and goodwill. I am convinced that the challenges of our time can be overcome only by countries acting together. To achieve our shared goals, we must go forward in the following directions.
The multiple and often interconnected crises of recent years have exposed significant gaps in global governance. They have highlighted the need to modernize and reform the United Nations. The United Nations must be better prepared for future challenges and opportunities. In that respect, Kazakhstan welcomed the proposals in the report of the Secretary- General on Our Common Agenda (A/75/982). This is an important opportunity to reaffirm the Charter of the United Nations, reinvigorate multilateralism, boost implementation of existing commitments, agree on concrete solutions to new challenges, and restore trust among Member States. We look forward to contributing to the consultations at the ministerial meeting next year and to the holding of the 2024 Summit of the Future.
We must move from simply responding to global challenges and crises to preventing and better predicting emerging trends and integrating our assessments into strategic planning and policymaking. For that very purpose, Kazakhstan proposed 30 years ago the idea of convening the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-building Measures in Asia. In the context of new challenges and threats, we hope to transform the Conference into a full-fledged international organization at the upcoming summit in October, in Astana, to contribute to global mediation and peacemaking.
With only eight years until 2030, the Sustainable Development Goals are hampered by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, a triple planetary crisis — climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution— and conflicts around the world. We need to get back on track before it is too late. Our top priority must be to build resilience against future turmoil and to ensure a sustainable, equitable and inclusive recovery. To that end, we need a frank dialogue between East and West and a new global security paradigm based on the principles of mutual trust and multifaceted cooperation. Given the current crisis and increased geopolitical tensions, there is an acute need for a process under the auspices of the United Nations that can lead to detente and conflict prevention.
Kazakhstan has suffered terribly from past nuclear weapons testing, so we understand very clearly the dangers of escalating tensions among nuclear Powers. For that reason, nuclear disarmament has become a key part of Kazakh foreign policy and we will be continuously struggling for a world free of nuclear arsenals.
Despite some progress in this area, unfortunately, the whole record is not that positive. We are alarmed by the increased rivalry and rhetoric of nuclear States. We are also concerned at the lack of progress made by the Review Conferences of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Elaborating new mechanisms to ensure disarmament and non-proliferation is a daunting task ahead.
Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need to manage and reduce biological risks and dangers. It should be of universal concern that we still rely on the Biological Weapons Convention — now 50 years old — without any effort to create an agency or body for international cooperation. In that context, I would like to reiterate my earlier proposal to establish an international agency for biological safety.
Along with threats to international security, climate change requires greater international cooperation and solidarity as well. Around the world, people are facing existential threats from weather and environmental change. If we are to turn this tide, we need more action, and we need it fast. Many of us have taken bold steps already. In Kazakhstan, we have pledged the total transformation of the oil- and coal-dependent energy sector into a net zero economy by 2060. To save our planet, we need investment at greater levels than we have ever seen.
However, climate action cannot come at the expense of development or modernization. Therefore, at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change later this year, Member States, as well as the global business community, must once again scale up their commitment to greater climate finance.
That agenda relates directly to the global food security crisis. My country, the world’s seventh- largest grain producer, is the breadbasket of Central Asia. We are committed to utilizing this agricultural potential to fight global food insecurity. Kazakhstan
will continue to act as a reliable supplier of grain and other food staples, first of all to the poorest countries. It also intends to grow its cooperation with the Islamic Organization for Food Security, located in Kazakhstan, as well as with United Nations agencies. It is imperative in that connection to exclude food and fertilizers from any sanctions and restrictions whatsoever.
Once again, current economic and social upheavals require a collective effort. Commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development remains an integral part of our national and global agenda. In addition, fair trade regimes are crucial to global economic recovery. In that context, I would like to commend the constructive decisions coming out of the twelfth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization, chaired by Kazakhstan.
The current geopolitical situation also highlights the importance of a reliable and diversified global transit and transport infrastructure. We are seeing this in our own region. Kazakhstan, the largest landlocked developing country, is becoming a vital Asian land corridor to Europe. The Trans-Caspian International Transport Route, or Middle Corridor, has received new impetus. We expect cargo volume through Kazakhstan to increase significantly in the years ahead. We must ensure that the Caspian Sea becomes a sea of peace and new opportunities. In the months ahead, Kazakhstan will help mitigate the most immediate impacts of limited access to energy and critical raw materials caused by trade and supply chain disruptions. In the long term, we aim to diversify our sources of energy, with a particular focus on green hydrogen and renewables.
Speaking about Central Asia, we should bear in mind that it has already become a region of vast opportunities for international cooperation. Together with our Central Asian partners, we are committed to strengthening political interaction and deepening economic ties to move our region forward. We have agreed to coexist as good neighbours and diversify our cooperation. This credo is based on our significant natural and agricultural resources, human capital, and transport and transit potential. We are a buffer market between East and West, South and North. We intend to work together with all stakeholders to address a pressing regional agenda that includes climate change, the Aral Sea, the rational use of water resources, border delimitation, combating extremism and expanding intraregional trade.
That is why we consider it important to establish a United Nations regional centre for the Sustainable Development Goals for Central Asia and Afghanistan in Almaty. Kazakhstan sees the future Afghanistan as a truly independent, neutral, united, prosperous State, living in peace with its neighbours. Therefore, we support the difficult process of nation-building in that country, including life-saving humanitarian assistance.
As President of Kazakhstan, I am absolutely committed to building a just Kazakhstan, one in which every citizen has the same opportunities, rights and protections. Justice in my country must prevail. Law and order will become pillars of our society. The most important part of this path is transformative political reform. Presidential and parliamentary elections will be held in Kazakhstan over the coming months. According to my proposal, the presidential mandate has been limited to one seven-year term. This is a real breakthrough in developing democracy in Kazakhstan. At the same time, we will be firmly adhering to my formula of “Strong President, Authoritative Parliament, Accountable Government”. I am convinced this formula excellently serves the national interests of Kazakhstan.
We also aim to de-monopolize the economy. We are taking steps to ensure that the wealthiest in our society play their part in our quest for a just Kazakhstan, along with diversifying our economy and increasing investments in human capital. Recently, I initiated the creation of a National Fund for Children. Starting in 2024, 50 per cent of the investment income from the National Welfare Fund will be allocated to special savings accounts for children until their adulthood. These funds could be used for education or housing purposes. A special private charity fund, known as “For the people of Kazakhstan”, also now provides assistance to ordinary citizens for health care, education and social security aims.
We aim to further expand the empowerment and participation of women in economic and public life. Comprehensive national transformation is not a simple process, and there will certainly be pitfalls and bumps in the road. But if we are firmly to meet the expectations of Kazakh citizens, we cannot deviate from this strategic path.
Over the past three years, we have carried out substantial transformations through four packages of political reforms. For example, new laws passed by Parliament have simplified political parties’
registration and reduced the threshold for parties to enter Parliament from 7 per cent to 5 per cent. To promote the wider involvement of citizens in governance, there is now a mandatory 30 per cent quota for women and young people in electoral party lists. To make local administration more accountable, local mayors are now elected directly. To foster a more open culture between society and Government, we have changed the law on peaceful assembly; Government authorization is no longer required. Following its international commitments on the fundamental right to life and human dignity, Kazakhstan abolished the death penalty.
A just Kazakhstan depends on our multi-ethnic and multi-confessional solidarity. The “unity in diversity” principle will be preserved at all costs. Last week, the seventh Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions was successfully held in Kazakhstan. The Congress once again highlighted the importance of religious tolerance, dialogue and mediation. We are ready to build bridges and provide platforms for dialogue wherever needed.
This year marks 30 years of Kazakhstan-United Nations partnership. The Organization has contributed strongly to the formation and strengthening of an independent Kazakhstan. Over that period, we have worked for the aims of the Charter in all major United Nations organs, from the Economic and Social Council and the Human Rights Council to the Security Council. Kazakhstan will remain at the forefront of advancing a more modern, efficient, transparent and accountable Organization.
Never in history have we had such a need for responsible leadership for the next generations. Remembering our past makes us responsible for our future. Together with other Member States, we will spare no effort towards building a safer, more sustainable and prosperous global community."
Kenya,KEN,Africa,"  51,393,000 ",3214,11.47000027,4.7,66.342,HIV/AIDS,Cardiovascular Disease,Lower Respiratory Infection,3214,6.25,"  36,714,102 ",71.44,8.47,"I am grateful for the immense privilege of joining everyone here in the General Assembly — a privilege made possible by the peaceful democratic transition that followed the free and fair elections held in Kenya on 9 August. Those elections stand as a testimony of the universal power of democracy, as well as the manifest ability of African peoples to invest in stronger nations and a secure future by using robust institutions, effective constitutions and the impartial administration of the rule of law to guarantee the realization of our shared objectives.
The General Assembly’s seventy-seventh session comes at a unique moment, as the entire world struggles with multiple grave challenges, including regional conflicts, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the triple planetary crisis, food insecurity and the rising cost of living.
I take this opportunity to congratulate the President on his election and to express my confidence that his wealth of experience offers us significant assurance of his good leadership. The motto of his presidency, “Solutions through solidarity, sustainability and science”, succinctly captures with particular resonance the urgent imperatives of our time. I assure the President of Kenya’s firm support and cooperation during his tenure.
I also take this opportunity to commend his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for his bold steps in steering the United Nations community and for ensuring its business continuity under the unprecedented circumstances occasioned by multiple global threats such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
Human well-being is under grave threat. The health of the planet requires urgent attention. The immense pressure exerted by conventional threats, such as climate change, the global food crisis, terrorism, cybercrime and armed conflict, has been compounded by the unprecedented and devastating disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. I express my approval of the President’s theme for this year’s session, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, because it boldly signals the window of opportunity that we now have to step up our engagement from firm consensus to decisive action.
In many respects, the COVID-19 pandemic stripped us of many illusions and exposed stark justice and solidarity deficits in the face of existential crisis. It brought into sharp focus the global economy’s two- lane highway, repressively patrolled by a rising tide of exclusionist nationalism — a spectre that undermines prospects for collective action and significantly impairs the resolve of the international community to guarantee the fundamental rights, including the rights to safety and dignity, of the world’s vulnerable majority.
It is also for that reason that many nations, especially in the global South, now advocate the democratization of global governance and a reimagined multilateralism that is inclusive and works for the good of all. Kenya stands ready to work with other nations to achieve the
pan-Africanization of multilateralism and a more just and inclusive system of global governance.
It is important to reflect on those matters as we do our best to get our people, enterprises and industries back on their feet so that the engine of development can power our societies towards a prosperity that actually leaves no one behind. “Building back better” is the universal rallying call to incorporate lessons learned into doing more, in a better way, to recover from shocks. I would suggest that we have a golden opportunity to faithfully adhere to that motto by augmenting it, in word and in deed, with an additional “b” to make it “building back better from the bottom”.
Building back better from the bottom upwards is essentially about including the marginalized working majority in the economic mainstream. The bottom millions relentlessly wage their daily battle for survival in a crowded arena that is characterized by scarcity of opportunity and a generally precarious existence. The ingenuity, optimism, resilience and energy demonstrated by those in that ever-bustling bottom segment is sometimes called hustling.
Invisible to policymakers and beyond the reach of many public services, those hustlers take nothing for granted, surviving overwhelming odds and frequently achieving great success. In the words of Abraham Lincoln, things may come to those who wait, but only the things left behind by those who hustle. It is time to bolster the resilience of our nations to mainstream those millions through deliberate strategies and efforts to advance economic inclusion by building back better from the bottom.
The interlocking challenges of conflicts, the triple planetary crisis and the global food crisis have impeded our momentum and obstructed our focus in achieving fundamental transformations towards sustainable development. In the Horn of Africa region, severe drought and the disruption of supply chains due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have left us food-insecure. Consequently, we have been constrained to repurpose our strategies to prioritize drought and famine relief to insulate education from disruption and improve social protection and health-care systems in order ensure people’s well-being.
Many countries now bear witness to the unsettling phenomena of rivers, canals and water reservoirs drying up owing to droughts and heat waves occasioned by climate change. Kenya is no exception. The northern, arid and semi-arid rangelands of our country have been gravely impacted by drought whose severity has not been experienced in 40 years. The scarce rainfall over three consecutive seasons has led to poor crops and pasture, leaving some 3.1 million residents of those rangelands severely food insecure. That unprecedented confluence of intensely adverse events has exacerbated water scarcity and starvation, which are worsened by rising food prices, thereby complicating Kenya’s road map towards delivering a good quality of life to its citizens and hindering our progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals 6 and 2.
Severe drought has affected not only the Horn of Africa and the Sahel regions; it also continues to devastate many others, including in Asia, Europe and the Americas. If for no other reason, the fact that we are in this together must strengthen the case for concerted efforts across the continents. With that in mind, I call on Member States and all relevant stakeholders to demonstrate strong political will and showcase effective cooperation by supporting the most affected countries both financially and by sharing land-restoration and climate-adaptation technologies. Collaborating to expand inclusion can usher in a new paradigm of multilateralism for us.
The latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reminds us that we cannot afford to waste another moment debating the merits of doing something versus doing nothing. It will soon be too late to reverse the course of events, and then, even the best possible interventions will not suffice. Every day is an opportunity for us as leaders to expedite our efforts to confront the triple planetary crisis.
It should be recalled that during the Stockholm+50 meeting, which Kenya had the honour of co-hosting with Sweden, there was agreement among States on the need to act urgently to address environmental impacts. Given that consensus, it is deeply concerning that little progress has been made with regard to the action that is needed. It is time to collectively contemplate the urgent measures needed to implement the high- priority actions we must take in order to contain the ongoing disruptions, as well as deliberate on longterm implementation approaches to be undertaken. I fully agree with the Secretary-General’s memorable statement, that “[w]e have a rendezvous with climate disaster” (A/77/PV.4, p.3). I add that we must not be taken by surprise. If being forewarned indeed means
being forearmed, this is our opportunity to mobilize with tremendous urgency and take action at once.
The agricultural sector has an important part to play in reducing the severity of climate change. A number of practices have a bearing, positive or negative, on various dimensions of the environment. Investing in modern agricultural technology is therefore one important avenue towards tackling prevailing environmental challenges. Kenya is responding through substantial investment in climate-resilient agriculture. At the core of our 10-year strategy for agricultural-sector growth and transformation are nine flagships. They include the registration of farmers to direct incentives, improving farmer practices through customized extension services, the monitoring of emergency food-reserve stocks using a digital food balance sheet and the use of an early-warning system to monitor food supplies and market prices.
Agriculture remains the bedrock of the development of many nations and will therefore continue to hold the key to ensuring equitable and sustainable growth for our people. No country, large or small, has ever attained significant growth without modernizing its agricultural sector. And as we rededicate ourselves to those targets, we must, in the immediate term, find answers to the severe deficit in the availability, flow and accessibility of fertilizer to our farmers worldwide. I could not agree more with Secretary-General Guterres’ warning in this Hall yesterday, that
“Without action now, the global fertilizer shortage will quickly morph into a global food shortage” (ibid., p. 2).
We are encouraged to note that education, health, agriculture and numerous other public services have become increasingly reliant on digital access. The world needs greater investment in the development of information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure, accompanied by policies that support innovation and increased acquisition and deployment of technology. In so doing, we should be driven by the conviction that those measures offer a viable shortcut to poverty reduction and the promotion of inclusive development. I call for stronger global partnerships to enhance ICT infrastructure in developing countries and bridge the yawning digital divide between the global South and the rest of the world.
The General Assembly’s seventy-seventh session follows the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), UNEP@50, as well as Stockholm+50 and the Ocean Conference in Lisbon. The outcomes of those conferences demanded real commitment to addressing global environmental concerns as a matter of urgency and a just transition to sustainable economies that work for all people.
The fifth United Nations Environment Assembly’s adoption in Nairobi of the March 2022 landmark resolution to end plastic pollution is a decisive signal that the world is prepared and motivated to act to address that menace. Kenya is committed to working closely with other nations to pursue legally binding instruments aimed at bringing an end to plastic pollution. As the host nation to UNEP and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme, Kenya affirms that those critical United Nations agencies have an indispensable role in the promotion of environmental sustainability globally, as well as in developing socially and environmentally sound sustainable cities.
In keeping with its strong commitment to multilateral institutions, Kenya has made more land available for the United Nations Office in Nairobi (UNON) to facilitate the upgrading of its complex. I take this opportunity to call on Member States to complement that contribution through enhanced financing aimed at adequately modernizing the UNON facilities Nairobi.
Kenya remains a strong advocate for making the sustainable use of ocean and blue-economy resources a development priority, holding the firm belief that significantly increased investment in that essential sector can end hunger, reduce poverty, create jobs and spur economic growth. I urge the Secretary-General to continue calling attention to the urgent need to develop that vital sector. In particular, I call on developed countries to invest in sustainable fishing, protect marine ecosystems and share ocean-based climate solutions with developing countries.
For our part, I am pleased to report that, building on the historic 2018 Sustainable Blue Economy Conference, held in Nairobi, Kenya is reviewing its national blue-economy strategy in order to strengthen community structures in the participatory management of freshwater, coastal and marine resources and ecosystems. The strategy is expected to contribute to our economic development through food and
nutrition security, coastal and rural development and income increases along the aquaculture value chains.
It will also enhance maritime transport and tourism. We invite development partnerships to invest in Africa towards building the capacity to sustainably utilize marine resources. We must rally together to make the best use of Africa’s vast blue resources in developing our economies while meeting our climate targets.
As we look forward to the twenty-seventh Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt, it is logical to expect that Member States will shift their attention towards the development and implementation of frameworks for climate change mitigation. Member States must complete their pending actions so they can turn to the implementation work that lies ahead. I therefore call on all of us to urgently deliver on all commitments made towards climate-change financing. It is critical to emphasize that we are running out of time in that regard.
Over the past decade, Kenya has sustained its aggressive pursuit of rapid socioeconomic transformation through three principal road maps. The first road map is the Kenya National Vision 2030, the formal long-term blueprint aimed at transforming Kenya into a newly industrializing, upper-middle-income country providing a high quality of life to all its citizens in a clean and secure environment by 2030. The second road map is the African Union’s Agenda 2063. The third road map is the Sustainable Development Goals. Kenya seeks to tap into a variety of resources to catalyse the achievement of those interlocking and mutually reinforcing objectives.
The disruption and ensuing crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic compelled us to diversify our focus into new interventions, including an economic stimulus programme, a COVID-19 economic recovery strategy and a COVID-19 socioeconomic re-engineering recovery strategy, all aimed at mitigating the adverse impacts of the pandemic. I confirm that we have done our utmost in the circumstances. Nevertheless, it is not enough. Kenya and the rest of Africa, like other developing countries, are in need of greater international partnership and cooperation to avert economic crisis in the wake of the pandemic.
Developing countries, which are heavily burdened by external-debt servicing, run the risk of losing development gains because of the shocks inflicted by the pandemic and associated disruptions. I call on global financial institutions and the international community to take urgent steps to release all existing financial instruments in order to provide much-needed additional liquidity and secure better fiscal space for developing countries such as Kenya to enhance social investment, support climate change adaptation and mitigation, address security needs and resolve development financing challenges.
On behalf of Kenya, I therefore join other leaders in calling on the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral lenders to extend pandemic- related debt relief to the worst-hit countries, especially those affected by the devastating combination of conflict, climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. I also urge the Group of 20 to extend and expand the scope of the common framework to suspend or reschedule debt repayments by middle-income countries during the pandemic recovery period.
I would like the Assembly to take a moment to consider the peace and security landscape — one that is currently beset with multiple challenges but also abounds with considerable opportunities. Our home region of East Africa and the Horn of Africa, in particular, is burdened by significant conflicts and challenges that have implications for the region’s development. We stand on the cusp of a vast opportunity to galvanize confidence-building measures in order to generate and sustain momentum towards sustainable peace.
In its role as an anchor State in the region, Kenya has sustained our investment in diplomatic efforts to find lasting peace in multiple situations within and beyond the region. Although some processes have yielded undeniable success, challenges remain. I therefore strongly reiterate our call for partnership towards confidence-building measures and urge more concerted efforts to achieve sustainable peace and stability.
Kenya is currently serving on the Security Council. I am proud to confirm that our engagement over the past two years has prioritized regional peace and security, countering terrorism and violent extremism, peace support operations and climate and security as critical contributions to collective efforts to build a safer, more prosperous and peaceful world. I am also proud to state that Kenya has continued to champion closer cooperation between regional mechanisms and the Security Council as an effective means for achieving international peace and security.
Kenya continues to advocate the renewal of the African Union Peace and Security Architecture, which draws comparative strength from the highly productive complementarity among the United Nations, the African Union and the regional economic communities. Working closely with the other two elected African members of the Security Council, we are committed to finding a stronger African voice in the Council and achieving a consensus-driven, rules-based multilateral system. It is our manifest intention to see greater pan- Africanization of the global agenda in order to make multilateralism work for the people of the world in their diversity. It is time for multilateralism to reflect the voices of the farmers, represent the hopes of villagers, champion the aspirations of pastoralists, defend the rights of fisherfolk, express the dreams of traders, respect the wishes of workers and indeed protect the welfare of all the peoples of the global South.
Let me express my country’s strong collective conviction that the relevance, legitimacy and moral authority of the United Nations will forever remain deficient and undermined in the absence of comprehensive reforms of the Security Council. We therefore remain firmly committed to reforming the Security Council to make it a more effective, representative and democratic global institution.
Given the magnitude and variety of challenges the world continues to confront, a more fit-for-purpose United Nations is urgently needed, one that possesses the legitimacy and efficacy required to deal with threats to international peace and security. A just and inclusive world order cannot be spearheaded by a Security Council that persistently and unjustly fails the inclusivity criterion. Similarly, threats to democracy will not be credibly resolved by an undemocratic and unrepresentative Security Council. It is vitally important for that critical institution to reflect the values it is entrusted to protect, defend and uphold on behalf of humankind. We welcome the call by President Biden this morning for the expansion of the membership of the Security Council as a significant step in the right direction and look forward to building consensus towards realizing that.
The COVID-19 pandemic severely disrupted health systems, thereby seriously challenging the implementation of programmes that are vital for the realization of the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To place us firmly back on track and accelerate our progress towards the SDG targets, it is imperative for us to foster sustainable partnerships among Governments, other State actors, civil society and the private sector. That modality of collective action is particularly vital for building resilient health systems, whose importance in enabling us to withstand future pandemics and other health crises can no longer be disputed.
For that reason, Kenya will continue to strongly support the development of legally binding World Health Organization international instruments in order to anchor global solidarity and promote equity. The fact is that the COVID-19 pandemic exposed, for all the world to see, the severe deficit of those critical values in our current multilateral configuration.
Global supply chains remained impervious to demand in the global South generally and to Africa in particular. Unequal access to vaccines underscored that unjust and unequal situation, with unforgettable clarity. Whenever human life, security and welfare are in jeopardy, it is immoral to administer interventions through frameworks that are anchored on fundamental inequality. We are all witnesses to admirable demonstrations of effective solidarity in response to crises in various parts of the world. Our knowledge of the possibility of spontaneous, yet resolute, global solidarity reinforces the African exception as particularly repugnant.
From genocides and civil conflict to famine and pandemics, the African continent is consistently left behind to bear the brunt of weak solidarity and the disastrous failure of multilateralism. History indicates that the last time that Africa was the focal point of strong and effective multilateral consensus was during the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, and the character of the ensuing interventions casts a long shadow to date.
Not to put too fine a point on it, but the failure of multilateralism during crises, which relegates the people of Africa outside the circle of moral consideration and normalizes humanitarian neglect and other casual injustices, is a failure of humankind. Nothing about Africa — I repeat, nothing about Africa or its peoples — makes it acceptable for that type of failure to persist in this era, and we have an urgent moral duty to do better and right that wrong.
For decades, Africa has borne the brunt of three epidemics — HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. I applaud innovative partnerships such as the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria for their progress in addressing the three menaces. I also welcome the ambitious targets set for the seventh replenishment cycle. Kenya is committed to supporting the Global Fund and implementing agreed targets in order to actualize our pledge at the Replenishment Conference. Kenya calls upon all countries implementing the Global Fund programmes, especially fellow African States, to remain at the forefront in championing the successful replenishment of the Fund. In that way, the mobilization of much-needed resources will be enhanced, thereby bringing us closer to the elimination of those dangerous diseases.
In conclusion, Kenya joins the Secretary-General in calling for the strengthening of multilateralism as the only sustainable path to a peaceful, stable and prosperous world for all. That is the imperative of our time and the call of this moment. It is time to work on the trust deficit with stronger conviction that none of us is really safe until all of us are safe.
The theme of the seventy-seventh session, “A watershed moment:	transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, demands that we recognize that the crises we must confront are interlinked in a complicated way. They can be effectively addressed only through more imaginative strategies and innovative formulas. A population of 8 billion people, in a densely networked world, increasingly looks up to the multilateral system as the anchor of their individual aspirations, both directly and indirectly through robust national frameworks. Therefore, the United Nations system is increasingly expected to be responsive to those needs, and the proceedings in forums such as the General Assembly are expected to speak to ordinary people in the far-flung reaches of our incredibly diverse globe.
It is impossible to address all their individual needs directly, but it is possible to respond to all of them by speaking with conviction to the universal values of equality, inclusion, justice, solidarity and collective action, while making sure that all our interventions effectively reflect them, with clarity. The integrity of the international order must be measured by the distance separating our resolutions, consensus and agreement from decisive actions, committed interventions and effective solutions. A watershed moment therefore demands that we reduce that gap drastically and quickly.
Kenya pursues numerous essential domestic agendas through the multilateral framework. We are heavily invested in the strength, effectiveness and eventual success of all the interventions formulated by the United Nations. It is important that the output of this forum and other similar forums achieve immediate resonance in the minds and lives of our young people, who still seek the opportunity to express and actualize themselves; our farmers, who work to feed our nations; our jua kali entrepreneurs, who strive in pursuit of success in the informal economy; and our professionals, who formulate policy, implement strategy and monitor service delivery in the public and private sectors.
Africa places immense value on the international community and the tremendous possibilities it can unlock through inclusive, sustainable and effective action to transform the lives of our peoples and establish lasting peace, security and shared prosperity. This watershed moment is our chance to turn the key and open that door of opportunity. We can make progress in addressing the triple global threats and liberate ourselves from the shame of the past failures of multilateralism. At this watershed moment, we must not only choose but also act decisively to bequeath to our children and their children a greener, safer, healthier and more abundant Earth. Let us do it together — inclusively and multilaterally."
Kyrgyzstan,KGZ,Asia,"  6,304,000 ",6065,7.28399992,5.3,71.321,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Digestive Disease,474,7.52,"  6,302,805 ",99.98,8.65,"I wish to congratulate the brotherly nation of Hungary on the election of its representative, Mr. Csaba Korosi, as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session. I wish you every success in this important international position, Mr. President, and the Kyrgyz Republic stands ready to support you. At the same time, I wish to thank Mr. Abdulla Shahid, the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session, for his hard work during difficult times for the world community, as well as for supporting the international initiatives of my country.
The United Nations was established 77 years ago after the worst world war in the history of humankind. Perhaps the founding States of the United Nations, which signed the international agreement to establish the Organization in San Francisco in 1945, naively believed that wars, destruction, hunger and suffering would end forever. I do not think so. Success can always be achieved if there is a mutual understanding that disputes and disagreements must be resolved in a spirit of good faith and compromise.
In the history of the United Nations, there have been many important victories and successes. Although conflicts occur with varying degrees of severity in different regions of the world, the United Nations has played an important unifying role as a moral authority in maintaining peace and security and providing for people’s wants and needs.
Now, with an unprecedented complication in the global geopolitical environment that has created alarming expectations in the international community due to the threat of the destruction of the fundamental foundations of peaceful coexistence and the inevitability of a major war, it is important for all of us to remember the high goals and objectives set down in the Charter of the United Nations, namely, to maintain international peace and security. To that end, we must take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace; bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, the adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations that might lead to a breach of the peace; and develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of the equal rights and self- determination of peoples.
Ever since our country became a State, we have consistently and strictly followed the United Nations Charter and have been fulfilling our duties in good faith. This March marked exactly 30 years since our country joined the United Nations, and recently, on 31 August, we celebrated the thirty-first anniversary of the independence of the Kyrgyz Republic.
We always strive to resolve our international disputes by peaceful means. In international relations, we always refrain from the threat or use of force against
the territorial integrity or political independence of any State. Looking back at the thorny path walked by our country, we highly appreciate the multifaceted contribution of the United Nations to the formation of Kyrgyzstan as an independent and sovereign State, and an equal and responsible member of the international community. Our people will never forget the support and assistance of the United Nations family in the formation of political, public and civil institutions, the strengthening of democracy and the development of a market economy. On behalf of our generous people and on my own behalf, I express my gratitude to all the leaders and staff of the United Nations system, who sincerely and selflessly helped us to realize the centuries-old dream of the Kyrgyz people to create their own independent State. To them, we extend our gratitude.
I take this opportunity to present to the international community from this rostrum the latest developments at the southern borders of our country, in relation to the aggravation of the situation at the Kyrgyz-Tajik border.
First, let me briefly touch on the history. The collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991 paved the way for territorial disputes and border problems, some of which have not been regulated to this day. While there were more than 20 disputed areas along the entire perimeter of the Soviet-Chinese border, five of them were in Kyrgyzstan.
I want to proudly remind the international community that we have successfully finalized border- regulation issues, first with the People’s Republic of China in 1996 and jointly with the Republic of Kazakhstan at the point of intersection of the State borders of the three countries in 1999, and subsequently with the Republic of Kazakhstan in 2017. We have now practically completed our joint work and are about to sign an agreement on the State border with the Republic of Uzbekistan. I am pleased to note that the State borders with these three neighbouring countries have become borders of peace, good-neighbourliness, friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation.
With regard to relations with the Republic of Tajikistan, I would like to note the following. Our two close, neighbouring peoples have been living side by side for a long time. We are united by common values, culture, traditions and customs. We share the same faith. Our peoples are connected by family ties.
Our legendary father Manas was married to the Tajik princess Kanykey.
I also recall that, legally, the collapse of the Soviet Union occurred on 21 December 1991 in the city of Alma-Ata, Republic of Kazakhstan, when the heads of 11 newly independent States adopted the Alma-Ata Declaration on the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The declaration stated that our independent States recognize and respect each other’s territorial integrity and the inviolability of existing borders. They indicate that the strengthening of relations of friendship, good-neighbourliness and mutually beneficial cooperation, which have deep historical roots, meets the fundamental interests of the people and serves the cause of peace and security. It is written that the countries recognize their responsibility to maintain civil peace and international harmony. That legal document was signed by all 11 Presidents of the CIS member States, including the Republic of Tajikistan.
The aforementioned principle was confirmed by the President of Tajikistan, Mr. Emomali Rahmon, in the declaration on respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and immunity of borders of the State Parties of the Commonwealth of Independent States, dated 15 April 1994. He signed and agreed. It is a pity that he is deviating from that principle now. He made his first official visit to the Kyrgyz Republic in 1998 after the end of the bloody civil war in Tajikistan. Later, two bilateral inter-State agreements were concluded between the Kyrgyz Republic and the Republic of Tajikistan: the Agreement on bases of the inter-State relations between the Kyrgyz Republic and Republic of Tajikistan of 12 July 1996 and the Agreement on Good Neighbourly and Partnership Relations of 26 May 2004. I want to note that both agreements were signed in Dushanbe.
From the very beginning of work on the settlement of border issues between our two States, the Kyrgyz side has always acted in full compliance with its international obligations, including bilateral ones, and conducted negotiations in a constructive manner, offering mutually beneficial compromises. I note that in April 2021, the armed forces of Tajikistan launched an unjustified and unprovoked large-scale aggression on our territory, killing 36 citizens and causing serious material damage. Although my decision to meet with the President of the Republic of Tajikistan in Dushanbe was heavily criticized by the Kyrgyz people —who
demanded that we meet at a neutral location — I flew to Dushanbe and met with President Rahmon in June 2021 to try and find mutually beneficial solutions to the border issues. For the sake of my people, I am ready to spend not only 10 hours on negotiations, as I did that day, but as much time as possible to resolve this issue once and for all.
Of course, whatever the solution is, it should be mutually beneficial. It is all the more painful for me to report that on 14, 15 and 16 September, large-scale military clashes took place in the south of Kyrgyzstan. Despite all previously negotiated agreements, the Tajik side, with ill intention, attacked border and civilian objects along the entire perimeter of the Kyrgyz-Tajik State border. About 140,000 of our civilians have been evacuated from border settlements. They are now being provided with the necessary assistance. In that regard, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the United Nations system, our friends and partners for their solidarity and support. Great material damage was caused to civilian and military facilities, including houses, administrative buildings, schools and frontier posts.
Any material damage can be restored. However, we cannot restore the lives of our citizens who were fired upon or those of the brave defenders who sacrificed their lives and died fighting for their homeland. We will never forget the bravery of our courageous soldiers.
We are deeply saddened by the unjustified armed aggressions by Tajikistan, despite international agreements and obligations established between our countries. Pacta sunt servanda is the Latin for “agreements must be kept”. We are ready to continue the negotiation process in a civilized and legal manner, in any format, with our Tajik neighbours. Considering that our trust has been weakened by the recent lawless actions of our neighbour, we are ready to continue negotiations and welcome the mediation efforts of international organizations, including the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the Collective Security Treaty Organization.
We have documented evidence of both yesterday’s and last year’s illegal and ill-intentioned actions of the Tajik side. We are never the first to start and never will be. We always try to avoid using weapons, and even more so, we never shoot at unarmed civilians. We are always forced to respond accordingly and adequately to the aggression of the Tajik side. In that regard, I emphasize that the Kyrgyz side does not claim foreign lands and does not intend to cede a centimetre of its land to anyone. We are convinced that all border and internal issues should be resolved at the negotiation table, and we are willing and ready in this regard. The most important issue today is the adoption of urgent measures to ensure security and stability in the border areas, to stop any actions aimed at increasing tensions among the local population, and to strengthen the trust between our two States. We are always ready for negotiations and clarification of our borders.
Regarding general United Nations issues, I would like to note the following.
This year, with half of the implementation period of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) having passed, we can now objectively look at the real situation at hand. The adoption of the SDGs in 2015, under the motto “leave no one behind”, was a bright example of the constructive negotiation capacity of the world community in the interests of all of us and subsequent generations. Meanwhile, it has already become obvious that owing to objective circumstances, including the coronavirus pandemic, the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals in developing countries, including our own, has slowed. Without adequate international funding, many may not even achieve the critical indicators of the SDGs.
I wish to reiterate the firm commitment of the Kyrgyz Republic to the SDGs and to their gradual implementation, taking into account our national capacities. I believe that our country’s own potential should be the main source and engine of sustainable development. For those purposes, our efforts are aimed at achieving the accelerated and qualitative growth of the economy, including through mutually beneficial regional and international trade and investment cooperation. For example, Kyrgyzstan actively participates in integration and cooperation processes, including the Eurasian Economic Union and the One Belt, One Road initiative of the People’s Republic of China.
The country is actively developing the locomotive of the “green economy”. With respect to the hydropower industry, small and medium-sized hydropower plants are being put into operation. Our esteemed neighbours Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan will participate in the construction of the largest hydroelectric power station — Kambarata — which will strengthen the energy security and optimize the use of water resources in the region.
In general, I want to note the spirit of unity, mutual understanding, trust and support that was demonstrated in the city of Cholpon-Ata two months ago, when the fourth consultative meeting of the Heads of State of Central Asia was held under the chairmanship of Kyrgyzstan. I hope that the signing by all parties of the Cholpon-Ata Treaty of Friendship, Good- Neighbourliness and Cooperation for the Development of Central Asia in the Twenty-First Century will open a new page in our inter-State relations. We are committed to continuing work in that format.
In conclusion, I want to assure the Assembly that Kyrgyzstan fully supports the United Nations as the only universal structure authorized by all of the States Members of the United Nations to meet the challenges faced by humankind. I hope that the United Nations will continue to properly perform all its functions and assist Member States in overcoming challenges and solving urgent global problems. I urge all Member States to provide unconditional political support and solidarity to the Organization in this difficult international time."

I wish him a successful presidency of this session. I have the honour to speak on behalf of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic in the Assembly.
We are at a critical juncture as the international community is facing multifaceted challenges, ranging from armed conflicts to environmental crises and an economic downturn that have set back global development. Multilateralism, which is always at the heart of international cooperation, has been undermined while unilateralism has been applied widely. These challenges, already exacerbated by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, have hindered and reversed the development gains attained during past decades. The implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has never before been so tarnished. It is disheartening that the most vulnerable peoples and countries are now suffering the most. Countries in special situations — namely, the least developed countries (LDCs), the landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) and the small island developing States (SIDS) — which have endured the most difficult period coping with COVID-19 impacts, are additionally confronting climate, food and energy crises. It is more urgent than ever before for the international community to find solutions, not only transformative, but also more practical, effective, action-oriented, sustainable and tailored to the most pressing needs, so as to ensure that the most vulnerable are not left behind.
Seventy-seven years after our United Nations was formed, we should no longer be here in the Assembly Hall to stake any claim, lecture, blame or shame one another. Our world needs greater attention, concerted efforts and common desire. We, as stipulated in the Charter, are the peoples of the United Nations. We shall gather here to find the most appropriate solutions and take the most urgent actions to address the problems we are all facing today. This cannot be done without firmly upholding the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and preserving multilateralism. Our United Nations was founded to prevent another catastrophic world war. Our shared wisdom and political will to find the most pragmatic and suitable solutions to the multiple crises threatening us all today must prevail over other, individual interests. In doing so, we must strengthen our solidarity, cooperation and collaboration and must not create confrontation and division. As such, it is necessary, after more than seven decades, that United Nations reform revitalize and increase its ability to effectively address global problems.
In this context, the United Nations needs to effectively fulfil its mandate in maintaining international peace and security, as well as in promoting development cooperation. It is our common desire that the United Nations be transformed in order to respond to the current global landscape and needs in our joint effort to overcome the unfolding challenges that threaten international peace and development. The international community must find peaceful and lasting resolutions to any conflict and disputes around the world, including the Middle East problem. We believe that unilateral sanction or measures cannot be effective, as they not only contravene the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, but also hamper the national development of other countries. Sanctions, regardless of their form, will end up compromising not only one’s own interests, but those of others and inflicting suffering on everyone.
We must also promote peaceful solutions based on our mutual interests and build an environment conducive to development so as to safeguard lasting peace and prosperity for all. In that regard, my delegation once again joins the overwhelming global call for the lifting of the economic embargo on Cuba and putting an end to all unilateral coercive measures, which have negatively impacted innocent people.
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has enjoyed long-lasting peace, security and stability, which have served as favourable conditions for the national socioeconomic development of all member States. We in ASEAN continue to promote regionalism and multilateralism that emphasize the importance of centrality, unity, inclusivity, mutual
benefit and respect, which are a solid foundation for all essential ASEAN cooperation frameworks. Under the ASEAN framework, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has actively participated and very responsibly contributed to the promotion of peace and stability. On that note, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic considers the role played by ASEAN as crucial for creating an environment conducive to a return to normalcy in Myanmar, and we should continue to engage Myanmar so as to ensure the continuation of the delivery of humanitarian assistance to its people and to explore ways and means to ensure Myanmar’s full and effective implementation of the five-point consensus towards tangible outcomes.
Since the inception of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015, the Lao Government has presented two voluntary national reviews, in 2018 and 2021, reflecting the progress made and challenges encountered in the implementation of SDGs through its national socioeconomic development plans, Vision 2030 and the National Green Growth Strategy.
Nevertheless, throughout the past three years, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a direct impact on the socioeconomic development of every country, especially the least developed countries, including the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. The progress made prior to COVID-19 in the implementation of our national development and international commitments, like the SDGs and others, has therefore been severely undermined, affecting peoples’ livelihoods at all levels.
In addition, we are also facing extreme weather events in various parts of the world due to climate change. Like many other countries, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic remains vulnerable to external shocks and has been severely affected by natural disasters, especially extensive flooding. Over the past years, our Government has attached great importance to combating climate change through the implementation of the revised nationally determined contribution, which clearly outlines the ambitious targets of national action plans with regard to tackling and mitigating climate change with a view to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. To that end, there is pressing need for adequate financial resources and technical support for gaining access to climate financing and other sources of funding to support developing countries, especially LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS, to achieve their development goals and commitments made under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. In that regard, we call for renewed political will, coupled with concrete actions, taken by the international community at the upcoming twenty- seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in order to preserve our planet for many generations to come.
Having recognized the multidimensional challenges and special needs of groups of countries in special situations, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic is strongly committed to the implementation of the internationally agreed development goals and programmes of action for LDCs, LLDCs, as well as other United Nations development cooperation frameworks. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic remains hopeful and firmly believes that multilateralism, with the United Nations as the lead institution, can appropriately address the multiple crises and challenges the international community is facing. We are strongly committed to supporting conflict resolution through peaceful means, guided by the United Nations Charter and other relevant international law. We are confident that development cooperation for common interests and shared benefits must continue to be at the core of international relations. To that end, more action-oriented solutions and non-politicized approaches must be adopted. It is our hope that the seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly will offer opportunities to enhance our solidarity and revive sustainable development paths in order for us to ensure transformative solutions to improve the livelihoods of our peoples and the planet.
I would like to end my statement by expressing, on behalf of the Lao Government and people, my sincere appreciations to all Member States for their kind support for our membership in the Economic and Social Council for the term 2023-2025. We stand ready to serve with humility and to make meaningful contributions to the work of the Economic and Social Council, and we pledge to discharge our duties in advancing partnership towards a more resilient and sustainable world."
Latvia,LVA,Europe,"  1,928,000 ",23362,8.710000038,5.9,75.172,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,384,19.92,"  1,928,000 ",100.00,10.98,"I confirm Latvia’s readiness to cooperate constructively with the President of the General Assembly. Our agenda is full and still growing. In the words of George Orwell, “Contrary to popular belief, the past was not more eventful than the present”. Let me focus today on a few fundamental themes.
My first theme is about upholding international law, which is the basis for world peace and the order established by the Charter of the United Nations. At the core of that order is respect for the sovereignty of States and a prohibition on the use of force. Starting a war of aggression is the gravest possible threat to our world peace order. Nevertheless, for seven months, Russia has been waging an unprovoked and unjustified war against a sovereign United Nations Member State, Ukraine. Let me stress that this is not just a regional security issue. Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine is a threat to global security and stability.
In the twenty-first century, Russia is maintaining a nineteenth-century ideology of imperialism, colonialism and racism. Russia invaded Georgia in 2008. It illegally annexed Ukraine’s Crimea in 2014. It has used increasingly aggressive rhetoric towards other neighbouring countries. Those are all manifestations of its imperialist and colonial ambitions. Denying another nation’s right to exist and promoting the idea of the supremacy of Russians and their special missionary role in the world are all contemporary expressions of racism, which is exactly the opposite of what the United Nations stands for.
Russia’s war in Ukraine has caused a humanitarian disaster. One third of the people of Ukraine have been forced to leave their homes. Russia is preventing Ukrainian-grown food from reaching the world market. Russia is also using its position in the energy market to exert pressure. High energy prices sustain high levels of global inflation, which most dramatically affects the world’s most vulnerable populations. Russia continues to spread false narratives about the causes of the global food, fuel and financial crisis. Those lies must be debunked. Russia alone is responsible for the crisis.
We, the law-abiding States Members of the United Nations, are responsible for supporting Ukraine’s self- defence and stopping the aggressor. Russia’s ability to finance its war on Ukraine must be limited. Global sanctions in the areas of finance, trade, transport and energy, as well as restrictive measures against individuals and legal entities, must be maintained and strengthened. Belarus, being equally responsible for enabling Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine, is also being sanctioned. Since the beginning of the war, Latvia has spent more than 0.8 per cent of its gross domestic product on military, economic, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. We stand with the brave people of Ukraine, whose heroic defence is seeing success. Today we learned that a partial mobilization has been declared in Russia, as its once-mighty army is overwhelmed. The blitzkrieg envisioned by President Putin has turned into a long nightmare. In another sign of desperation, Russia plans to hold illegal referendums in the next few days on the annexation of the occupied territories to the Russian Federation, which is in blatant contravention of both Ukrainian and international law. Latvia will not recognize the legitimacy of those referendums, or their results, and I urge the international community to do the same.
Impunity translates into an invitation to commit further crimes, and the aggressor must therefore be held accountable. The International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court have already started proceedings on particular aspects of Russia’s war against Ukraine. The European Court of Human Rights has also initiated proceedings. However, a legal gap remains. No international court has jurisdiction over the main issue — starting a war of aggression, the gravest possible violation of the Charter of the United
Nations and international law. I therefore call for the establishment of a special tribunal, whose main task would be to investigate the Russian State’s responsibility for the commission of the crime of aggression. After the war, Russia will have to pay reparations to Ukraine for damages. The tribunal could be part of an international reparations mechanism and could be established through the adoption of a resolution by the General Assembly, by another international organization or a group of like-minded States.
Let me now turn to the issues of sustainable development and climate change. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is our common road map for overcoming our challenges and creating future-oriented, sustainable and inclusive policies. This year Latvia submitted to the United Nations its second progress report for the Sustainable Development Goals, highlighting the areas of education, gender equality, youth participation and international cooperation. The implementation of the 2030 Agenda is also the overarching goal of Latvia’s development cooperation policy. Over the past 30 years, Latvia has developed expertise in democratic processes, good governance, socioeconomic change and gender equality. Good governance, especially strengthening the rule of law and democracy, accounts for more than 40 per cent of all the support provided by Latvia. As a member of the Peacebuilding Commission, we are sharing our expertise in societal resilience. Joint efforts must also be continued to address the consequences of climate change, including through development cooperation efforts. For example, in Central Asia, we have been working on the promotion of clean energy technologies. The problem of global justice is particularly related to climate protection. Latvia supports the view that the greatest polluters should bear a greater burden for that protection. We therefore advocate for greater justice and solidarity regarding the global agenda.
We are convinced that digitalization is one of the most important agents of change. Latvia supports innovative and proven digital solutions that promote the efficiency of public administration, public participation in decision-making and the creation of new economic opportunities. In that regard, I would like to highlight the areas of security and fundamental rights in the digital space, which is an integral part of our lives and has enormous potential to contribute to the sustainable development of nations. We must therefore resist attempts to turn it into a battlefield where international law is flouted and basic rights are ignored. The use of people’s data in ways that are incompatible with their human dignity, rights and security must be prevented. The Internet must be open, free, reliable and secure. We support the proposal made by the Secretary- General in Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) to agree on a global digital compact aimed at reducing the digital gap between developed and developing countries. Both the coronavirus disease pandemic and current geopolitical challenges highlight the need to strengthen society’s resilience by combating disinformation, promoting media literacy and strengthening media freedom. Accordingly, Latvia is actively preparing for the upcoming eleventh Global Media and Information Literacy Week. Critical thinking skills build up our immunity to disinformation.
The aggression by a permanent member of the Security Council against another Member State is undermining the basic principles of the multilateral system that we have been building for decades, a situation that once again confirms that meaningful reform of the Security Council is essential. As a firsttime candidate for membership in the Security Council in the 2025 elections, Latvia takes the responsibilities of membership very seriously. We will strive to make the Council more effective, accountable, coherent and transparent. Latvia supports a more just and equitable representation of Member States, especially those in Africa.
The Baltic States have much to contribute to the work of the United Nations. For us, the horrors of war, occupation and harsh rule by a colonial Power are within living memory, as is the fight for liberty and restored independence and a transition to a successful, sustainable economy and the rule of law. We have no wish to dominate or intimidate anyone. We reject the idea of spheres of influence. As smaller States, we have an existential interest in effective multilateralism. Latvia will therefore continue to contribute to the work of the United Nations in a spirit of optimism and determination.

Lebanon,LBN,Asia,"  6,859,000 ",12683,6.640999794,5.2,78.875,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,190,2.77,"  6,859,000 ",100.00,6.34,"I offer my sincere congratulations to the President on his election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.
I also take this opportunity to thank His Excellency Mr. Abdullah Shahid for his good stewardship of the previous session and for all his efforts in that regard. I would like as well to commend His Excellency Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his continued efforts to promote the role of the United Nations Organization and develop its work.
The world today is in a very delicate situation, involving armed conflicts and interrelated crises that are of concern to us all. There is no better place to deliberate those challenges than in the General Assembly Hall, which brings together all the world’s States under the auspices of the Charter of the United Nations, which my country, Lebanon, is proud to have played a role in establishing. We have enjoyed decades of productive cooperation with the United Nations.
In that context, I am delighted to thank the President of the General Assembly — and through him, the United Nations, with all its branches and specialized institutions and those operating in Lebanon — for their efforts to help Lebanon and contribute to mitigating the consequences of the crippling economic and financial crisis that it now faces.
I would like to thank in particular the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon for its sacrifices and efforts to maintain stability in southern Lebanon, in close coordination with the Lebanese army. With the help of Member States, we look forward to strengthening the military capabilities and alleviating the financial burdens of the Lebanese army. In that context, we stress Lebanon’s commitment to the full implementation of the provisions of resolution 1701 (2006) and all resolutions of international legitimacy.
With regard to the demarcation of our maritime borders, under the auspices of the United Nations and with the commendable mediation of the United States, I would like to reaffirm Lebanon’s full commitment to its sovereignty and rights over, and its enjoyment of, its territorial waters and exclusive economic zone. We reiterate our sincere desire to reach a long- overdue negotiated solution. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that we have made significant progress in that regard and hope to soon reach the desired outcome.
Lebanon is determined to protect its national interests and the wealth of its people, as well as to invest in its national resources. We are fully aware of the importance of the promising energy market in the eastern Mediterranean for the prosperity of the economies of the countries of the region and for meeting the needs of importing countries.
Lebanon believes in the leading role played by the United Nations. We stress our commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
We also believe in the international frameworks that address disarmament issues in their various forms and welcome efforts to establish an international understanding to rid the Middle East of weapons of mass destruction pursuant to decision 73/546. We commend the previous sessions of the Conference on the Establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear
Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction and look forward to the successful conclusion of its third session, to be held under Lebanon’s presidency in November. We also look forward to contributing to the establishment of that nuclear-weapon-free zone.
Many countries in the world today face severe economic crises, the causes of which are multifaceted and well known, as they have had a major impact on all aspects of life. That has made it imperative for many Governments and countries to resort to extraordinary measures in seeking to alleviate the impact of such crises on their peoples.
In my country, Lebanon, we have faced the worst socioeconomic crisis in our history for the past several years, which has affected all our institutions and placed the majority of Lebanese below the poverty line. It has caused many people to emigrate, with our homeland losing many of its best and most promising young people. That comes on top of severe and unprecedented economic deterioration, the collapse of the national currency to its lowest levels in history and the closures imposed by the coronavirus disease pandemic, not to mention the Beirut port explosion catastrophe, the cause of which we are seeking to determine. We are also dealing with the consequences of the Syrian crisis and the burden of those who have been displaced.
In that context, the Lebanese Government is confronted by an unprecedented political crisis that has made it necessary to tread very slowly and carefully across a political and economic minefield in order to remedy the situation and create an environment conducive to pulling Lebanon out of its current crisis.
Our Government has succeeded in achieving many of its goals, most notably in the timely holding of parliamentary elections despite the difficult circumstances prevailing in the country. Nevertheless, the road ahead of Lebanon continues to be long, arduous and fraught with difficulties before it can overcome the crisis. We are working with all our resources and determination to successfully achieve that. In that connection, our Government signed a preliminary agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
From this rostrum, we pledge to advance all necessary legislative and administrative reforms in order to overcome the current crisis. We continue to count on the assistance of Lebanon’s international friends, most notably the sisterly Arab States. Lebanon, an Arab country by affiliation and identity and the co-founder of the League of Arab States, has great respect for the Arab States. Lebanon’s Arab affiliation and its commitment to Arab causes reflect the provisions of its Constitution and the Taif Agreement, which ended the bloody civil war that ravaged my country. I must reiterate our full commitment to the Taif Agreement, as well as our unwillingness to tolerate any attempt to undermine its provisions.
We also reaffirm our commitment to our policy of non-alignment, which we have pursued on the same path as our previous Government, in an effort to protect our country as far as possible from adopting any position that it cannot sustain. The Lebanese Government also relies on the United Nations and its Member States, which through their commendable assistance to Lebanon have always emphasized that a capable and prosperous Lebanese State is urgently needed to ensure peace and security in the region and the world.
In the context of efforts to address the economic crisis, our Government is also working on a financial and economic recovery plan that complements our cooperation with the International Monetary Fund. We are working on a package of comprehensive structural and sectoral reforms that meet the requirements of the Lebanese people and provide them with a social safety net. We are also developing laws that ensure absolute transparency and combat the scourge of corruption, which has been exacerbated as a result of the economic collapse.
At the same time, we are working to revive the economy and to benefit from the many potential opportunities, especially with respect to the younger generations, for whom we are responsible. They are a beacon of hope for the success of a Lebanese economic model that is open to the world and offers it new opportunities.
In that context, we appeal to sisterly and friendly countries to stand by Lebanon in its ongoing crisis and support us in overcoming it by addressing the serious repercussions of the crisis on the Lebanese people and the structure of the State. We look forward to reconvening the Friends of Lebanon Conference for Investment and Finance, which has long been hosted by France in cooperation with Lebanon’s friends and brothers.
The existence of a sovereign and independent Lebanese State — that is strong and capable; protects the parliamentary democratic system and public and
private freedoms; believes in tolerance, fraternity and convergence; and pursues its policy of non-alignment, rejecting the policy of axes — is urgently needed in order to ensure peace, security, stability and prosperity in the region.
In addition, a strong central Government that ensures the rule of law and its proper application, as well as an enabling environment for businesses, productive sectors and services in all their diversity — in accordance with market standards, a free economy, current requirements, and the information and communication revolution — is urgently needed by the entire region and presents the best way for all of us to tackle the challenges of poverty, unemployment, extremism and terrorism and to avoid spiralling into the unknown.
For more than a decade, Lebanon has been at the forefront of achieving the global public good by hosting a massive number of displaced Syrians. It is difficult to provide accurate figures of their number. Since the beginning of the Syrian crisis, we have adopted an open- border policy based on our commitment to humanitarian considerations. However, the displacement crisis currently exceeds Lebanon’s capabilities.
It is also important to emphasize that the Lebanese Constitution, with the consensus of all Lebanese people, prevents any integration or settlement on its territory. The only realistic sustainable solution is to achieve the safe and dignified return of Syrians to their country in the framework of a road map that we should start work on as soon as possible, with the cooperation of all parties. Additional qualitative assistance should also be provided to the Lebanese State and its various institutions and infrastructure, which have been overstretched by the large influx of displaced persons for more than 10 years.
The Palestinian question remains the main obstacle to the achievement of peace and stability in the Middle East. The injustice against the Palestinian people must end. The independent Palestinian State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, must be realized in keeping with all the relevant resolutions of international legitimacy, including resolution 194 (III), on the return of refugees to their homes.
Concerning the Palestinian refugees, I would like to emphasize the central role played by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East in serving the goals and purposes of the United Nations by helping to alleviate some of the suffering of Palestinian refugees and achieve a measure of regional development and stability.
In that regard, we express our deep concern about the Agency’s critical financial situation and accumulated budget deficit, which jeopardize the delivery of its services. We also reiterate that Lebanon welcomes and supports all international efforts to bridge the deficit, as the primary challenge remains finding a sustainable solution to the funding gap.
Lebanon has a long cultural history. Lebanon has always promoted a message of peace, tolerance and dialogue. Although my country is currently experiencing challenging times, those difficulties will not deter the Lebanese people from moving forward to achieving once again their prosperity and strengthen the pioneering role that Lebanon has always played internationally. We want Lebanon to be a place for convergence, not division. We want Lebanon to be a space for dialogue, not competition. We want it to be a spiritual custodian that brings together the values of the divine religions and the values of truth and justice in the world. I am confident that, with the unity of its people and the help of its brothers and friends, we can achieve what we want.
In conclusion, I reiterate my gratitude to the United Nations for its continued cooperation and partnership with Lebanon and to all Member States that love and support Lebanon. I reiterate my call on everyone not to disassociate Lebanon from all the conflicts in the region and the world. The greater the challenges, the more we are willing to work together for the good of our people.
The recent series of global crises have demonstrated the importance of international cooperation in addressing them, as most of them have become transboundary in nature. I would like to conclude by referring to the beginning of the United Nations, when it commenced its collective work in solidarity and complementarity for the benefit and well-being of humankind, based on justice, security, peace and sustainable development. We hope for a better world, especially in the Middle East region.
I extend my best wishes to all members."
Liberia,LBR,Africa,"  4,819,000 ",764,2.388999939,4.1,63.73,Cardiovascular Disease,Malaria,Diarrheal Disease,220,4.57,"  1,326,898 ",27.53,2.21,"I am honoured to address this seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly on behalf of the Government and the people of Liberia. Let me congratulate His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at this seventy-seventh session and assure him of Liberia’s fullest support. I would also like to commend his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for a job well done in administering the affairs of the seventy-sixth session of the General Assembly. Let me also extend my profound thanks and appreciation to His Excellency Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his remarkable and visionary leadership.
This year’s Assembly is taking place at a difficult time when, even as the world is recovering from the scourge of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we continue to face the challenges of the war in Ukraine, climate change and its devastating effects on our environment. Just as the Ukrainian people are enduring the harsh impact of this unwarranted military incursion, the rest of the world is feeling the harsh consequences of economic downturn caused by disruptions in global supply chains, food insecurity and the rising prices of basic goods and services.
The theme of this year’s Assembly, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, is both appropriate and meaningful. It not only reminds us of the current state of our world, but provides us the space to reflect on the multiple challenges that confront us today. They include the health and socioeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the devastating effects of climate change, environmental concerns, poverty reduction, food insecurity and gender inequality. The challenges confronting the world today will require immediate collective global actions, with the United Nations at the centre of the search for solutions. In so doing, we must give special consideration to the needs of developing countries, particularly the least developed countries, in line with the Doha Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2022-2031.
Working together with the United Nations family, Liberia hereby commits to protecting our planet, promoting peace, preventing conflicts, ensuring sustainable financing and boosting partnerships. That commitment is reflected in the Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development, which embodies the expression of our shared determination to achieve peace, prosperity and national development and to address extreme poverty, inequalities, regional disparities, infrastructure deficits, climate change and equitable distribution of our national wealth.
Given Liberia’s youthful population of more than 60 per cent, my Government initiated a youth rehabilitation and empowerment programme, the Socioeconomic Empowerment of Disadvantaged Youth Project, between 2019 and 2021, with the subsequent launch of a $13-million national fund drive for the rehabilitation and empowerment of at-risk youth in Liberia. We remain of the firm conviction that, when empowered, our youth can be a positive force for good.
As Liberia’s feminist-in-chief, women’s empowerment and the promotion of gender equality remain key priorities of my Government. Women not only comprise almost half of our country’s population; they also play important roles at all levels of our society and must be given deserved equal attention, support and a place at the leadership and governance tables in our society. To that end, we have developed a legal framework, including the ratification of regional and international instruments to address gender inequalities, which arise as a result of sociocultural perceptions, practices and stereotypes that support male dominance and the subordination of women.
I would like to inform the Assembly that my Government, together with United Nations partners, is implementing the European Union Spotlight Initiative to end violence and harmful traditional practices against women and girls and promote their sexual and reproductive health and rights. Furthermore, the Government of Liberia is currently implementing a $50-million project funded by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to enhance the capacity of female entrepreneurs.
I would like to express Liberia’s sincere gratitude to our local and international partners, both multilateral and bilateral, for their continued support of our national efforts in combating the pandemic. As a result of that support, Liberia is well on its way to achieving herd immunity, hopefully by the end of this year, with 67 per cent of the population already fully vaccinated.
My Government continues to take actions through the formulation of new policy frameworks and strategic interventions to address the impacts of climate change and protect the environment. Liberia is committed to achieving the target of a 64-per cent reduction in carbon emissions below business as usual by 2030. We anticipate that the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Egypt, will provide the opportunity to accelerate work towards achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
Sustainable development can take place only in a peaceful and secure environment. In the fulfilment of our commitment to the maintenance of regional and global peace and security, Liberia takes pride as a troop-contributing country, with Liberian troops and other security apparatuses serving in the United Nations
Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, the United Nations Mission in South Sudan and the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei. We thank the United Nations and our bilateral and multilateral partners for the support that we continue to receive in facilitating our contribution to global and regional peace and security.
I am pleased to report that the International Monetary Fund’s latest appraisal of its ongoing programme with Liberia is very positive. It shows that inflation rates have been significantly reduced. There are now better prospects for economic growth compared to previous years, despite the negative effects COVID-19. Our efforts in instituting new policy measures to fight graft are also particularly commended in the report, along with our adherence to prudent fiscal management.
Democracy in Liberia also continues to grow from strength to strength. After many years of civil upheaval, Liberia is becoming a stronghold of peace and a safe haven for democracy. That is because we have taken actions in the past few years to build and strengthen democratic institutions, such as the press and the Liberian judiciary. We have put forward new legislation that empowers the media, while eradicating laws that have tended to suppress free speech. I am proud to say that, from the beginning of my Administration to date, there have been no political prisoners in Liberia.
At the regional conferences of the Mano River Union and ECOWAS, which have been convened to discuss efforts to restore democracy in a few trouble spots in our West African region, Liberia has constantly and consistently pleaded for strict adherence to constitutional term limits and a return to democratic civilian rule in cases of military takeovers. Liberia is expected to hold presidential and legislative elections in October 2023. The upcoming elections will be crucial to consolidating our democracy. In that regard, I underscore my Government’s unwavering commitment to ensuring that the enabling environment will continue to exist for the holding of peaceful, free, fair, transparent and inclusive elections. That is in keeping with my commitment to ensuring that the democratic will of the Liberian people is respected at all times.
In the run-up to the 2023 elections, it is incumbent upon all prospective candidates to avoid the incitement of violence and any other behaviour that could deprive the Liberian people of the peaceful space that they need to freely exercise their franchise and express their political will in choosing their leaders. We must let the people decide, and then we must respect their decision. That is indeed the true essence of democracy.
If we are to advance the common good of humankind, the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals, then international cooperation must be given primacy and the principle of solidarity must have its rightful place. We have the platform to generate the transformative solutions that we seek. The world is watching. Our people are watching. We must now seize the moment, confront the challenges and collectively endeavour to lift the poor from poverty, hunger, sickness and disease and ensure progress, development and prosperity for all. At the same time, we must protect our planet and guarantee and maintain global peace, security and stability.
We must pursue efforts to make the United Nations more efficient, more effective, more inclusive, more accountable and more suited to its purpose."
Libya,LBY,Africa,"  6,679,000 ",8096,17.68400002,5.5,72.724,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Road Injuries,304,4.55,"  4,655,754 ",69.71,Not Avalable,"At the outset, it is my pleasure on behalf of my country’s delegation and myself to congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session. I wish him every success.
I also express my sincere thanks and appreciation to Mr. Abdulla Shahid for his efforts and invaluable work during his presidency of the General Assembly at its previous session. I further commend the continuing efforts of Mr. Antonio Guterres, who leads the United Nations with wisdom and balance in times that are difficult all over the world.
My country, Libya, which I am honoured to serve and represent, has endured a decade of suffering and hope while building its institutions and establishing the principle of democracy. The Libyan people have demonstrated to the world that they are one fabric, knit together with the same cohesion as their land and shared future. In spite of all their challenges, the Libyan people have continued to work to build a united country thanks to their thoughtfulness, tolerance and patriotism. They give us the determination and hope we need to continue working to realize their aspirations to build our State and pave the way for peace, stability and prosperity.
Current events constantly remind us of the past. The Libyan Liberation Army, which was established even before the creation of the Libyan State, fought alongside the armies of the free world. After the fall of Nazism and fascism, Libya earned its full independence, born of our national struggle and a regional and international agreement that paved the way for our founding fathers to build our State, unite our homeland and embark on a path to development and prosperity that made Libya an example of development in record time.
International policies on Libya today are still far from the reality we need. The individual interests of the countries involved in Libyan affairs, combined with proxy wars and disagreements on how to resolve Libya’s situation, have not given us an opportunity to establish our own national choice. Negative international interventions have led to contradictory solutions that push my country towards armed confrontations that do not spare innocent people and have resulted in intransigent political positions that do not allow for a middle ground where gaps can be bridged and national partnerships realized.
The Libyan Presidency Council remains committed to its role, pursuant to the Libyan Political Agreement. As the supreme political authority, the Presidency Council represents the country’s unity, locally and internationally, while assuming the role of commander-in-chief of the Libyan army. It is also responsible for the noble task of leading inclusive
national reconciliation efforts in order to pave the way for a democratic and peaceful transition of power through simultaneous presidential and parliamentary elections. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the African Union for cooperating with us in launching the National Reconciliation Project, which is the most important pillar supporting all paths to the stability and peace we desire. Those responsibilities compel us to contribute to impartial and balanced national efforts, despite attempts by certain political parties to push us towards confrontation, which we are making every effort to avoid. We are trying to resolve political disputes, not participate in them. In that regard, the Presidency Council has also been closely following the rounds of dialogue between Parliament and the High State Council. That dialogue has yet to result in an agreement on the constitutional rules for holding the parliamentary and presidential elections. The Presidency Council continues to stress that such dialogue should not continue indefinitely and is ready to intervene to break the political deadlock, if necessary.
With regard to the economy, the Libyan Presidency Council supports all the efforts that have made it possible to restore gas and oil production in every region of Libya. That is certainly in line with national interests and helps to maintain stability in international markets, which have been under severe pressure, especially in countries that are major energy consumers. Furthermore, based on its balanced national position, the Libyan Presidency Council is committed to the transparent and fair management of oil revenues, which are a wealth that belongs to all Libyans. The goal is to ensure that public funds are not a cause for political conflict and are used to benefit all Libyans throughout the country without discrimination on political or geographic grounds. If we manage to achieve that goal, it will reduce the current conflict for power and create a more stable environment conducive to the democratic transition we desire.
My country takes a positive view of the role of the United Nations in Libya in spite of the recent slow pace of intervention, and we continue to expect it to play an active role through the new leadership of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya. We call on the United Nations to embark on serious efforts in support of inclusive national solutions that can help break the political deadlock. The current impasse has paved the way for individual ventures and initiatives that risk undermining all the political gains that have been made thanks to the Libyan dialogue held under the auspices of the United Nations.
I also call for restoring momentum to our economic process. It is one of the three tracks of the Berlin Conference on Libya, which neglected issues related to transparency and justice in the management of oil resources, public expenditure and addressing corruption.
While we may have thought that the errors of the past would never be repeated, today’s world is on the threshold of a new international order that brings reminders of the suffering that humankind endured in the early twentieth century. It is high time for human conscience to speak out in favour of peace and for the entire world to support the international principles adopted by the United Nations in order to uphold the principles of maintaining the sovereignty of States, resolving conflict by peaceful means, respecting good-neighbourly relations and refraining from destabilizing the security of nations.
I also call for respect for the right of people to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, in line with the criteria defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Furthermore, my country is on the front lines in the fight against terrorism. I call for renewed unity in combating terrorism, as it remains a threat to every country and spares no race, religion or civilization. My country has taken on all of its responsibilities at the international level to stop the financing and spreading of terrorism.
I reiterate from this rostrum my country’s permanent commitment to supporting the right of the Palestinian people to establish their own State, ending Israel’s settlement-building and acts of aggression and upholding the international resolutions on the issue.
This month the Libyan people observed a minute of silence to mark Martyrs’ Day. It is also a tribute to the martyrdom of our national hero, Omar Al-Mukhtar, who resisted the colonizers.
The Libyan people are inspired by the combat of its ancestors to learn patience and to be more determined in defending their rights. The Libyan people draw inspiration from their founding fathers to become more tolerant. The current period will be enshrined in the national memory. Future generations will recognize those who supported us and those who undermined our security and plundered our wealth.
Owing to its position in Africa with Arab neighbours, Libya is a link between civilizations and an economic hub where the interests of the world are concentrated. The damage that we have experienced has affected not only the Libyan people, but also the region and our international relations."
Lithuania,LTU,Europe,"  2,801,000 ",26182,7.070000172,6.3,75.737,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Digestive Disease,721,25.74,"  2,801,000 ",100.00,10.98,"Standing before this Assembly of world nations, I wanted to speak about peace and about challenges that the world is facing today — income inequality, pandemics and climate change. Unfortunately, today I have to speak about war — the war in Europe, a war that only deepens and does not resolve other issues.
Ever since the founding of the United Nations, the Organization’s central idea has been that of bringing countries together and ensuring peaceful coexistence. After the terrible suffering of the Second World War, addressing global threats to international peace and security was the overriding concern. We owe a great deal to those past leaders who struggled to recreate global order out of profound disorder. The darkest hour in human history inspired the creation of the rules that remain essential to the global coexistence of nations. For the first time in our history, peace finally became a global value to be protected. Against all odds, the language of military aggression and conquest was condemned.
In the context of global challenges, we often talk about human rights, but what about countries’ right to be sovereign and defend their territorial integrity? On 24 February, a permanent member of the Security Council started an unjustified, unprovoked and illegal war against a neighbouring country. That gross violation of international law undermined the very essence of the United Nations. For the past seven months, Russia’s war on Ukraine has taken a terrible toll on the Ukrainian people. Many thousands have been tortured and killed. Millions have been displaced or forced to flee their homeland.
However, the war has not broken the will of the brave Ukrainian people to defend their country. It has not diminished their fighting spirit. The massacres at Bucha and Izyum have not brought them to their knees. Their inherent love of freedom, passed from one generation to another, is still there, undefeated, unspoiled. Despite all the challenges, Ukrainians have proved to be remarkably strong defenders of liberty and democratic values. Inspired by their heroic struggle, the international community should take an even more active role in boosting Ukrainian resilience to withstand their hardships.
Every State Member of the United Nations is expected to respect the rules of international order that we have created over the course of decades, and it is up to us to decide what can be tolerated and what cannot, where the red lines are and when they are crossed. How can we tolerate a member of the international community in a war of conquest and annihilation, a country that is deliberately attacking the rules-based world order, a country whose actions make it more difficult for all of us to maintain peace and security across the globe?
Today I call on everyone here to look closely at what is happening in Ukraine. Who is the aggressor and who is the victim? Behind the mask of an energy superpower there is a dangerous colonial Power seeking to occupy and annex its neighbours, searching for reasons to justify the annexation, rewriting history, using economic and energy blackmail and spreading disinformation and propaganda.
We all know that Russia’s violations of the founding principles of the United Nations did not start seven months ago. Its destructive actions have undermined international security for many years, breaching arms- control treaties, using prohibited chemical weapons
both at home and abroad, continually violating the territorial integrity not only of Ukraine, but of Georgia and Moldova as well, and interfering in the elections of other countries. Those are just a few examples.
The ongoing suffering of the Ukrainian people has been further amplified by Russia’s proxy, the Belarusian regime. It has enabled military attacks by another country from its territory. It continues to provide support for offensive operations against Ukraine. Unfortunately, it has surrendered Belarus’s national sovereignty to its big neighbour.
The past few months have also revealed the danger of a looming nuclear disaster in Europe. The deployment of Russian military personnel and weaponry at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant is alarming and totally unacceptable. It disregards the safety and security principles that all members of the International Atomic Energy Agency are committed to respecting. A nuclear power plant should never be used as a military base.
Moreover, Russia’s irresponsible rhetoric on the possible use of nuclear weapons directly contradicts its role as a permanent five (P5) State and the commitment it made in the January P5 leaders’ statement on preventing nuclear war and avoiding arms races. We see a huge gap between declarations and real actions that is undermining trust in a permanent member of the Security Council. We must collectively condemn such actions and require Russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw all troops from the entire territory of Ukraine. It must also stop its irresponsible and dangerous nuclear rhetoric and behaviour. That should include withdrawing military and other personnel from the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant.
Lithuania therefore welcomes the active personal involvement of the Secretary-General. His visits to Ukraine demonstrate supreme dedication to the ideals of the United Nations. We note that the efforts of the Secretary-General and Tiirkiye were instrumental in reaching the deal on resuming Ukrainian grain exports. We also acknowledge the positive role played by other actors, such as the African Union leadership, in coming to that arrangement. It is an achievement shared by the whole community of nations. Once again, international efforts have helped us to avert a global catastrophe. The grain exports via Ukrainian ports will sustain and feed millions of people.
We should be in no doubt that it was the war in Ukraine that threatened to trigger global hunger, and we cannot be sure that this danger will not return until the Russian armed forces are withdrawn from the whole territory of Ukraine.
There must be no impunity for the brutal crimes and atrocities committed during the war. Guaranteeing justice and accountability is of vital importance from the standpoint of the credibility of the United Nations and the international community. We should consolidate and advance our legal efforts. We must ensure that all those responsible for this unprecedented assault on Ukrainian and European peace and security are held accountable. Lithuania will continue to engage in accountability mechanisms to address the mass atrocities being committed in Ukraine. I call on the global community to establish a special tribunal to address war crimes in Ukraine. It is also crucially important to ensure effective forms of reparations for the victims of those crimes.
Finally, we must consider the fact that Russia’s war in Ukraine is an extension of the wider context. What do we see in Russia? The human rights situation there is deteriorating. Independent media and non-governmental organizations are being simply banished. Similar developments are taking place in Belarus. Systematic and widespread attacks target civil society, human rights defenders and independent media. The number of political prisoners in Belarus now exceeds 1,200, and it continues to grow. That is truly alarming and requires more attention from the international community. Lithuania has provided asylum to Russians and Belarusians — representatives of non-governmental organizations and independent media — who were persecuted in their home countries.
For Lithuania, the time for a business-as-usual approach is over. We have demonstrated that by building energy independence and accelerating our green transition. I invite all countries to stop financing this bloody war by refusing to buy the aggressor’s energy resources, which would significantly affect its ability to continue this brutal war.
Lithuania has supported Ukraine since the first days of this terrible war. We have not been silent. We have stepped up to help Ukraine in every way we can. Our Government, as well as civil society, has been active in providing both military and humanitarian aid. We have taken in more than 60,000 refugees, mostly
women and children. To help them maintain a sense of belonging, we have established a Ukrainian centre in Vilnius, the first centre of its kind outside Ukraine.
The war must end, but not with peace at any cost. Ukrainian territorial integrity must be fully restored. Any other outcome would mean further atrocities and long-standing insecurity. While the aggressor has already demonstrated its eagerness to endanger the global population, we should not allow ourselves to be frightened. The danger is real. As history shows, pushing back against the aggressor is the only viable option.
Today I remain a strong believer in the transformative power of collective action, based on the principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Together we can ensure global peace and security. Together we will make a difference. Let me assure the Assembly that Lithuania is and will always be a valuable partner in fighting for the right cause — in fighting for long-lasting peace."

We thought that war belonged only in history books. However, our continent is now experiencing war on its soil. I think that our strength is precisely our solidarity, our unison and, above all, our unity.
I am proud that, with its partners, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is contributing to the European Union’s determined action to promote common values — human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights. As Europeans, we are wholeheartedly committed to defending such values, which are the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, and to strengthening multilateralism — doing things together, with the United Nations at its heart.
For his presidency, the President has framed the general debate under the theme “A watershed moment”, and he stressed the need to find “transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”. I want to say that we are currently at a watershed moment for the entire world and for the United Nations.
For almost seven months, the Russian Federation, which, I do not need to recall, is a permanent member of the Security Council, has been waging a full-scale war of aggression against Ukraine, a sovereign neighbour, with the involvement of Belarus. For many people, and perhaps in many other countries, on the European continent anyway, that unprovoked and unjustified war has revived the fear of a war. As I said a moment ago, now more than ever, it is again becoming a matter of wondering if it is possible. The recent threats and measures announced by Moscow only exacerbate the situation. I want to say that we strongly condemn them.
We face a situation with the Russian veto and the Security Council deadlocked. That is difficult. The Secretary-General condemned Russia’s clear violation of the United Nations Charter. I do not need to remind Member States that, on 16 March, the International Court of Justice indicated provisional measures requiring the Russian Federation to immediately suspend the military operations.
This Assembly also met in an emergency special session and adopted three resolutions in that context (resolutions ES-11/1, ES-11/2 and ES-11/3). We also see that a large majority of the members of this Assembly condemned Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and demanded a ceasefire.
At the request of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, I, as Prime Minister, also wanted to do something. I held talks with the Russian President. As there are representatives of the Russian Federation in this Hall, I must say that I do not regret having tried. I am disappointed with the outcome when, for example, I heard President Erdogan say last week that there would perhaps be peace, and, the same day, President Putin announced the organization of referendums. When we ourselves organize a referendum, we know how long it takes. Organizing a referendum in time of war and, if I understood correctly, going knocking on doors and asking people to vote at the ballot box, I do not know how that would be arranged. One cannot organize a referendum in the current circumstances.
The population is being driven abroad. I even fear that the referendums will be an excuse to justify further actions, to say that it is a Russian territory, and that Donbas must therefore be protected by Russia, and to support the use of even more brutal means than those already being used. I regret that.
I appreciated the discussions that I had with President Putin — the exchanges and the frankness. But I must say that today I note that it is easy to begin a war, but the greatness of a political figure is rather to know when to end it and to want to get out of it.
I do not know how President Putin is now going to explain. In recent days, there has also been the mobilization, where young people are requested to join the Russian troops. How is he going to explain to mothers that they are going to lose their sons, to wives that they will lose their husbands and to children that they will lose their fathers to a meaningless war? I have now been Prime Minister of my country for nine years and, as a politician, I have always tried to find answers to the questions that I ask myself. I say to the Russian representatives that this is the first time that I was not able to find answers. I cannot understand. I therefore once again appeal to their President that there be a ceasefire and diplomacy.
I made those calls but, after Bucha, I could not go on. I say it frankly. I could not understand. In particular, finding out that soldiers who had committed crimes were being decorated is intolerable to me — and that word is not strong enough. It is unacceptable to me.
The war continues. It has already claimed more than 14,000 victims among the civilian population in Ukraine, including more than 1,000 children. When we see the mass graves that are being found, with people who have been beaten up, which is what I also saw in Bucha — summary executions — every day that it continues is one day too many.
I would also like to say that the Russian aggression also poses threats to Ukrainian nuclear facilities. In many countries, people are frightened. It is an unacceptable risk for Ukraine, but also the other European countries.
As I said, about three months ago, I travelled to Ukraine. I visited the towns of Borodyanka, Bucha and Irpin, where I met — forgive me, but I am talking about a personal experience — a woman who had lost everything, but she remained hopeful and retained the will to believe in peace. She was there with her grandson, who had become deaf from the bombings next to him. I say to the Russian representatives that one cannot condemn a country and a generation. One cannot kill innocent people. I cannot find the words.
When I saw the impact of the atrocities committed by the Russian military forces, I could only bow to the memory of the children — the innocent — who pay with their lives, shattered by the war.
I say it here, and I also said it in Kyiv: Ukraine can continue to count on us to help it to defend its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders and the right to legitimate defence, as enshrined in Article 51 of the Charter. It is our responsibility to help Ukraine. We cannot accept a larger neighbour. Those here can see that I am not from one of the larger countries in terms of its size or its army, but I cannot imagine living in a country where I would have to worry about the extent of action of my neighbours. I think that the greatest project that my continent has seen is the European Union. If I have lived in peace since 1957, it is precisely because we try to build things together. It is true that my country is between France and Germany, which were enemies at the time of the Second World War. Today we are partners, and we are building something together.
I would not be here today, and I would not be living in a democracy, if countries that were not my neighbours, but other countries, had not helped us. In Luxembourg, we too opened our doors to people fleeing war. Those people are not seeking a better life; they simply want to live. We welcomed more than 1,000 students from Ukraine to our schools. Whether it is in Kyiv or in our country, there is the courage of those students, families, children and men in Ukraine who have also begun to rebuild their country and revive their cities, liberated after the barbarity that took place there. We must constantly honour that courage and support the investigations carried out by national and international actors — I am thinking in particular of the International Criminal Court — so that those responsible for war crimes and other crimes committed in Ukraine are identified, prosecuted and punished. There can be no impunity, not for war crimes, crimes against humanity, the crime of genocide or the crime of aggression.
Let me take this opportunity to also commend the courage in Russia, because President Putin has now called for a mobilization, and we see young Russians leaving their country. As Mr. Michel said earlier, we cannot talk about war by just condemning it. It is already too late, for what has taken place is inexcusable. A ceasefire and an end to the killing of innocent people are things that are close to my heart. I will say why I am so sensitive to this subject. I had a grandmother who was Russian and a grandfather who was Polish. I have a grandfather from Luxembourg and a French grandmother. My grandmother was Orthodox, my grandfather Jewish, the other grandfather an atheist and the other grandmother a Catholic. Even in my country, having Jewish blood, being liberal and one’s husband being a man, I would have been condemned to death in my own country. Let us accept differences. Let us accept the wealth of diversity. If we are to live in peace, let us not make the same mistakes. I appeal to President Putin. I said earlier that starting a war was not the most difficult, but knowing how to get out of it is where one recognizes greatness, particularly as this war started at a time when most of us sighed with relief that we were leaving the coronavirus disease behind. We thought that we were going to be able to leave it behind.
Now there is food insecurity, particularly in countries with vulnerable populations in Africa and the Middle East. I reiterate to African colleagues, for I know that the narrative that it is European sanctions that create problems for the food crisis is false. It is the war, the aggression in Ukraine that is responsible for the problems that they are experiencing.
I must also thank President Erdogan, who sat at the table to try and find a way out of the Black Sea for Ukrainian grain exports. It is a crucial agreement for millions of people.
We are also seeing a rise in energy prices and very harsh consequences for many Europeans as well. It is easy to say that we should abandon the sanctions. What I would like is that we give up the war — not us, but them, our Russian colleagues.
I would also like to welcome the Secretary-General’s initiative to convene the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance to identify short-, medium- and long-term solutions. I thank Antonio Guterres and his teams for their tremendous efforts, as I said earlier, regarding the agreement with Tiirkiye.
We must also express our support for the World Food Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the International Fund for Agricultural Development in strengthening food resilience.
Today we see that the Sahel region is suffering from food insecurity, amplified by climate change and the effects of the war. Not long ago — and I would like to thank the leadership of President Bazoum — I was in the Niger, a partner country of Luxembourg’s cooperation. We want to work towards more stability in the region. I also remember when I met Mr. Roch Kabore and Mr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita. The leaders have now changed. I think that stability in Africa is a tragic element, together with other existing crises.
I am proud to be Prime Minister of a country where 1 per cent of its gross national income is allocated to official development assistance (ODA). As most Member States can imagine, every time we talk about official development assistance, there is someone who will say: why are they helping others; there are still problems at home? But I am proud of the 1 per cent assistance. When we see some problems that we have at home, they are tiny compared to others.
We also want to contribute to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, the partnership with Africa is crucial. We intend to strengthen it at the continental level, between the European Union and the African Union, and at the bilateral level. That partnership goes beyond traditional cooperation, focusing on social sectors, such as health care and education. It extends to cooperation on renewable energy and the fight against climate change, as we are also doing with our partners in Cabo Verde. It also extends to cooperation in technology and information and communications. I was recently in Kigali, in Rwanda, where we continue such collaboration.
If we want to be credible partners, we must particularly not just hold donor meetings, because they tend to do only that, but also deliver on our commitments. It is pointless to meet to make promises, but then not keep them. For my part, for example in terms of climate financing, my country decided to apply the principle of additionality. Our financing is therefore in addition to our ODA.
At the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in Glasgow, I announced that the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg was going to increase its climate financing to €220 million for the period from 2021 to 2025. Half of that funding will go to adaptation to climate change in the most vulnerable countries. We also intend to invest an increasing share in innovative instruments to mobilize private financing.
We are a European leader in sustainable financing. We play a major role in mobilizing the private capital needed to finance the transition to carbon neutrality, including with the European Investment Bank in the area of sustainable financing.
Given the climate emergency, I must say that, as politicians, we are at times a little timid. We ask ourselves if we should or should not act. We wonder what the consequences will be if the temperature increases by 1°C or 2°C. But some countries wonder how long they will even exist. They risk being erased from the map of the world because of the temperature rise. Are we as aware of that? In Luxembourg, I launched the Citizens’ Climate Council, where we asked 100 people to meet and make proposals. We realize that our citizens’ proposals are often bolder than how we, as politicians, think. It is quite an interesting experience, and we need to listen to them.
Many of us will meet in Sharm El-Sheikh. We must mobilize to stay on course for the 1.5°C target that we signed up to in Paris. Only by making joint efforts can we manage to mitigate the impact of climate change. Allow me to also think about our friends in Pakistan and what is happening there.
Climate change also has an impact on human rights, in particular the rights of children. That is among Luxembourg’s priorities at the Human Rights Council, where we are also committed to promoting gender equality, fighting against discrimination, strengthening the rule of law and civic space and combating impunity. Allow me to have a thought for Mahsa Amini in Iran and what happened with the morality police, who decided a woman’s fate. As I said before the Assembly last year (see A/76/PV.13), is it normal that, depending on my place of birth, my rights differ, and that, depending on my place of birth, if I am a member of a certain religion, I do not have rights? Is it normal that, if I have a different political view, I do not have rights and, if I am of a different sexual orientation, I do not have rights? In some countries, I would even be condemned to death. And if I am a woman, I have less rights than a man. That is a reality today in 2022.
It is therefore very important that we continue to have the independent international commission to investigate violations of human rights. Unfortunately, that has an increasingly heavy workload at the international level.
We are committed to living up to the responsibility of Luxembourg having been elected to the Human Rights Council for the 2022-2024 term. This is the first time that we have had the honour of a seat on the Council. I would like to take this opportunity today to thank Member States very warmly, on my own behalf and on behalf of my Government and country, for having placed their trust in us.
The President emphasized the fact that we are at a decisive turning point and that we all should meet the various challenges facing us, be it war or climate change. We must find common responses. We must also act together. To those who say that the United Nations is powerless, I say that the United Nations is what we make it. It all depends on our ambition and what we manage to do with that. It is up to us to mobilize to find solutions and forge partnerships and compromises that allow us to strengthen multilateral cooperation.
This spring, for example, Luxembourg had the honour of facilitating, together with Bangladesh, the negotiations that led to the adoption by consensus of the first declaration on the progress made in the implementation of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (resolution 76/266). We were also involved in the efforts that led to the adoption by consensus of the Liechtenstein veto initiative (resolution 76/262). It establishes a permanent mandate for this Assembly to debate the use of the veto in the Security Council. We have a system. It is what it is. Let us make the best of it. We also need Security Council reform. The United Nations cannot be a dog that barks but does not bite — a dog without teeth. It is important that we achieve a United Nations that works. We manage to explain what this body is. Let us recall why we are here. It was after the Second World War that we wanted to sit around a table to find solutions and work together. Today the United Nations should not be a place where, by means of a veto, I can obstruct the will to build something together.
We therefore welcome the work that has been launched to follow up on the proposals made by the
Secretary-General. A few days ago, the Transforming Education Summit was held. The decision was taken to establish the Office of the Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth.
The involvement of young people is crucial because they will be paying for the mistakes that we are making today. We must have the courage to recognize that politics, of course, involves achieving short-term objectives but most importantly, it is about the legacy we leave to future generations.
I therefore want to assure the Assembly that Luxembourg will continue to place itself at the service of the United Nations in order to champion our common values — the values of humanity. That is why the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is also submitting its candidature for a seat on the Security Council for the 2031 to 2032 term. It is why we continue to be committed to peace and security in Ukraine, Mali and the Middle East. It is why we are committed to rights for all human beings and supporting humanitarian action for the people of the Sahel and Syria. And it is why we will always be at the ready to defend the Charter of the United Nations. I hope that by the time we meet here next year the ongoing atrocities in Ukraine will have been relegated to history."
Madagascar,MDG,Africa,"  26,262,000 ",1307,1.797000051,4.1,66.681,Cardiovascular Disease,Diarrheal Disease,Lower Respiratory Infection,1476,5.62,"  8,859,506 ",33.74,4.71,"At the outset, allow me to address Mr. Korosi, Director of Environmental Sustainability at the Office of the President of Hungary. His election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session sends a clear message about the road mapped out for us by this annual meeting of the United Nations. I offer him my sincere congratulations. I would also like to warmly commend the Secretary-General for his ongoing commitment and dedication at the helm of the United Nations.
On behalf of the people of Madagascar, I would also like to take the opportunity provided by this forum to reiterate our deepest condolences to the British people. Queen Elizabeth II inspired several generations in her country and all over the world. I also want to congratulate His Majesty King Charles III and wish him good health and a blessed reign.
The annual meeting of the General Assembly is always an opportunity to highlight the aspiration that unites us, that is, universal peace. Now that we have learned to live with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which we have discussed at length over the past two years, we are still facing the consequences of the crisis, despite everything. It has shown us that it is at the most difficult times that we realize the importance of solidarity among nations. The theme of this session, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, is very apt. It gives us new hope, reassures us and gives us new hope that we can advance together along the path of development. When we had to tackle the health crisis, we chose to put our trust in our scientists and in the wealth of Earth’s natural resources. The establishment of the Pharmalagasy pharmaceutical plant, at the height of the health crisis, demonstrated that we could turn difficulties into opportunities in order to exploit our biodiversity and thereby protect our population. While we predicted the apocalypse for Africa, Madagascar’s infection and death rates are among the lowest in the world. We have been classified as a green zone, meaning a country with low risks of infection. At the moment no PCR tests or health certificates are required to enter Madagascar. We beat the statistics and emerged from the crisis stronger, and above all, more committed to ensuring our country’s development.
The world was just beginning to recover from the pandemic when new crises emerged. No country was spared the effects of COVID-19, and the conflict in Ukraine has worsened instability and heightened inequalities. That is yet another major obstacle to our efforts to achieve resilience and post-COVID recovery. Like every other country in the world, we are experiencing the full inflationary effects of this crisis. We firmly believe that all wars end around the table. Dialogue is the only way to bring about peace. Madagascar therefore reiterates its call for dialogue to resolve the conflict, because its effects are global and
becoming more burdensome by the day. Developing nations such as ours are feeling and paying the price. The crucial role of the United Nations must be to encourage multilateralism in order to find equitable solutions that take into account the strengths and weaknesses of every country and its people.
How can we accept the fact that in this time of crisis, countries with gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of more than $100,000 and others with per capita GDP of less than $600 are buying barrels of oil in the same market and at the same price? Our Organization should take measures to support low-income countries so that they can benefit from and supply themselves with oil at equitable prices, given that the current global situation is a source of major upheaval in a number of countries. Some States are now affected by instability. The social fabric is unravelling, and economies are increasingly fragile. Some States have been forced to raise fuel prices by 50 per cent, which has resulted in riots and socioeconomic disturbances. Recovery is a concern that we all share. Our solidarity is the only way we can heal our societies, revive our economies, support growth and establish peace.
Every country has now had to review its development strategies, and that has emphasized how essential it is for each of us to accelerate industrialization and become self-sufficient. We continue to believe that we should produce and process everything that our populations need domestically. There are weapons more powerful than bombs, tanks and missiles, which are our lands, our raw materials, our natural resources and our people. Local industrialization, agricultural innovation and leadership are our ammunition in the work of strengthening ourselves and our armour in order to protect our peoples.
In Madagascar, we have developed a detailed strategy to make up for the delays our development has suffered. We developed our 2019-2023 Madagascar Emergency Plan and began to implement it when I took office as President in 2019. Our vision is clear and reflected in our political will, which we have demonstrated through all of our actions. We have prioritized a sector- and project-based approach in order to raise Madagascar’s classification to that of a newly emerging country. We have launched an ambitious set of reforms to modernize our administration, develop our human capital and foster strong, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, with energy as the driving force of its development. Madagascar is a country that is blessed with water resources for hydroelectric dams, a high number of sunshine hours for solar power plants and wind power for wind farms. Many countries are facing energy problems today, and we must therefore accelerate our renewable energy production so that we can achieve self-sufficiency in the next five years. We intend to double or even triple our energy production capacity.
It is 2022. Regrettably, Africa is still a continent where most families live in darkness and obscurity. More than 600 million Africans, including 85 per cent of Malagasy households, still use candles and oil lamps to light their homes. That is why we are launching a major operation to equip most Malagasy homes with solar kits by the end of next year, with some of them, of course, subsidized by the State. In achieving that, Madagascar intends to be the first or one of the first countries on the African continent to have brought light to all its people.
Climate change is one of the major challenges of our time and one that we all have to tackle. It is important and urgent that we mobilize our joint efforts to protect our planet. I would like to raise the alarm here about commitments that were made at the twenty- first Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and reaffirmed at COP26, regarding the creation of the Green Climate Fund, which was supposed to be funded annually in the amount of $100 billion. Madagascar was the fifth African country to complete its national adaptation plan, and my country therefore should have been a beneficiary of the Fund. However, the access to funding is slow and so far none of the commitments have been upheld. It is unfair that the least-polluting nations should pay the highest price for the impact of climate change.
Madagascar is an island and therefore vulnerable to climate hazards. This year alone, five cyclones struck the island in the space of just two months. Some 178,000 hectares of arable land were flooded and destroyed. Our island is the first country to have endured a climate-induced famine. Water resources are drying up in the south of the country and the people in that area are the most vulnerable on the island. The effects of climate change are worsening. The global situation is calling us to action. How many high-level meetings, summits and international conferences have we already had? How many statements and commitments have we made? Now we have to transform our words into
actions. Today I am relaying the cries and the voices of the African continent in general and Madagascar in particular. Africa’s young people and indeed the entire continent are waiting for polluting countries to comply with the agreements they have made. Keeping those promises will protect our planet. Our populations demand that those promises be kept, and future generations will hold us accountable later.
Environmental protection issues are particularly dear to my heart. We all know that forests are the lungs of the Earth, and yet the use of charcoal and firewood remains standard practice across the African continent, including by 92 per cent of the population of my country. A family using charcoal or firewood for cooking destroys approximately one hectare of forest every year, which is devastating. We must change the practice and the mindset. That is why Madagascar will equip 250,000 families with bioethanol stoves with the aim of preserving 250,000 hectares of our forest every year.
We have started major public works projects to transform the country because everything needs to be built or rebuilt. Everything is urgent, and everything is a priority. For the past almost four years, we have been constantly building and repairing roads. We have built schools, health centres, hospitals, dams, courts, prisons in line with international standards, sporting and cultural facilities and much more. And Madagascar is continually evolving, despite the successive global crises. Ours is a large country and considerable work has been done to ensure that all areas are accessible. However, the road is still a long and winding one. But we have faith, and we will continue to move forward with determination. The Madagascar Emergency Plan is literally paving the way for the future.
From north to south and east to west, all of Madagascar is under construction. Only last week we opened our state highway 5A in the north of the country, which until now had for decades been a dirt road that took a week to traverse in the rainy season. Now it takes only two hours. It has led to an immediate reduction in the costs of the transportation and movement of goods and people, considerably improving the lives of the local communities and contributing to socioeconomic development in my country’s northern regions. In the south of the country, we are starting work on state highway 13 and will soon do the same for highways 10 and 44 in the east, thereby facilitating access to Madagascar’s main granary. In the north-west, state highway 31, which is currently under reconstruction, will be entirely restored, which will mean that we will have access to our second largest agricultural area. In a few weeks we will be starting work on the country’s first major highway, which will link the capital to our largest port. Once the work is completed, the journey will be shortened from 10 hours to only two and a half.
The demographic dividend is a variable that we have to include in our equation. We must change the structure of our population. Our current demographic growth is not commensurate with our economic growth. In some areas, girls under the age of 18 are already mothers of families who on average have to care for between five and eight children. It is therefore harder for them to feed and properly raise, care for and educate those children. Our family planning programme, which has already been launched, is therefore a crucial part of our strategy for controlling our birth rate and transforming the current population from one that is dependent to one that is employed and economically productive. Our demography in Madagascar will be an asset to our development and no longer an obstacle to it.
With regard to education, we have made great strides. My Government has built more than 1,000 classrooms and has made huge investments in teaching tools and material. We have set up school canteens. We have published books and textbooks and distributed tablets so as to considerably improve the quality of education received by our children and young people. Access to basic education has increased by 146 per cent and the school dropout rate has significantly decreased. We have made education a national priority, and we reiterate our commitment to transforming and revitalizing schools and universities.
Last year, I had the opportunity to speak (A/76/ PV.6, p.7) about my country’s wish to finally see the implementation of resolutions adopted by the General Assembly in 1979 (resolution 34/91) and 1980 (resolution 35/123), concerning the return and administration of the Indian Ocean lies Eparses or Nosy Malagasy to Madagascar. We welcome the upcoming second meeting of the joint French-Malagasy commission on the subject, and based on those two resolutions, which confirm the legitimacy of our claim, we hope to have the support of the United Nations in finally reaching a fair, settled and peaceful solution.
During the pandemic, the sick needed oxygen to survive. Many countries are currently still struggling
to breathe, thanks to the effects of successive crises. They need the oxygen they require to breathe in the form of support, aid and assistance, which will help them tackle the challenges of socioeconomic recovery and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. We must accelerate the pace of the implementation of new financing mechanisms, such as the Resilience and Sustainability Trust, to ensure the disbursement of funding. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the friendly countries that have always stood with us in the most difficult times.
The Africa of tomorrow must be autonomous, independent and prosperous. We have a duty to change the history of the continent and to write a new chapter so that each of us and each of our countries can change and be transformed. Our Organization needs to strengthen its solidarity to provide shared solutions to our common problems.
May God bless each of our nations. The homeland is sacred."
Malawi,MWI,Africa,"  18,143,000 ",950,5.897999763,3.3,63.798,HIV/AIDS,Cardiovascular Disease,Neonatal Disorder,1007,5.55,"  2,697,278 ",14.87,5.51,"Leave no one behind — those four words are the promise at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. That is the principle to which this United Nations body is committed. But today, more than three and a half years after that commitment was made, smaller nations and younger democracies around the world already feel that was an empty promise. Today not only do smaller nations and younger democracies, such as Malawi, still feel that they have been left behind, but they feel much farther behind than they were before.
For instance, we all know that climate change is a global problem that will never be solved unless all nations solve it together. Yet, months after Malawi and its Sustainable Development Goal gains were set backwards by two tropical storms in quick succession, we have been left behind. We all know that pandemics are a global problem that will never be solved unless all nations solve it together. Yet, in the roll-out of vaccines and the application of travel restrictions, we have been left behind.
We all know that regional insecurity is a global problem that will never be solved unless all nations solve it together. Yet, in terms of participation in Security Council decisions that affect us, we have been left behind. We all know that food shortage is a global problem that will never be solved until all nations solve it together. Yet, in the allocation of international facilities for agro-based and debt-distressed economies, we have been left behind.
As a result of our collective negligence, the global economy is now a house on fire. Yet we continue to use evacuation methods that rush some nations out to safety while leaving the rest of us behind to fend for ourselves in the burning building. However, if we are truly one United Nations family, then leaving no one behind must be practiced, not just preached. If we are truly one United Nations family, we must reject any attempts to politicize human suffering by lobbying us to refuse the help of those some find politically offensive.
If we are truly one United Nations family, we must abandon political posturing and welcome more helping hands in resolving the problems that the permanent members of the Security Council have sometimes created and failed to solve alone, namely, the failure to stop environmental degradation, prevent unjust wars, lift unsustainable debt burdens, prevent food insecurity and contain pandemics.
How do we get back on track? As I see it, with so many left behind, the only thing to do is to concentrate United Nations support on the most vulnerable who are lagging behind so that they can catch up. Malawi stands ready to do its part in using any new support it receives to make up for lost ground and catch up.
On addressing the current global food crisis, Malawi is ready to catch up, having just joined the Feed the Future initiative, which will give us access to new financing in the next few years to use Malawi’s vast arable land and large volumes of fresh water to develop mega farms that will feed the world and lift millions of our farmers out of subsistence living. We are delighted that many private sector investors are flocking to us to join the agricultural revolution that is coming to Malawi, as well as investors in mining, who know that the recent discovery in Malawi of the largest deposit of rutile in the world means that Malawi’s economic rise is imminent.
On climate change mitigation and adaptation, Malawi is ready to catch up. With the twenty-seventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to be held imminently in Sharm-El-Sheikh, we call for action on the pledges that have already been made so that Malawi and other least developed countries (LDCs) can build resilience to climate-change induced events, such as floods, droughts, pests and cyclones — all projected to become more frequent and more severe.
Those disasters reverse years of developmental gains. Cyclones Ana and Gombe alone destroyed strategic infrastructure and community assets and displaced thousands of households. One fifth of our people are currently at risk of acute food shortage — 3.6 million Malawians face hunger from next month until March. As we prepare to deploy food assistance from our strategic reserves, we welcome members’ support through early-warning systems for generating and managing climate data to reduce the impact of disasters, as well as technical and financial capacity-building on weather data analysis, modelling and forecasting to address the barriers faced by farmers in accessing useful information.
Our ongoing institutionalization of our national climate change fund should help in that regard, as will other measures for making climate financing predictable. Although Malawi and other least developed countries contribute the least to climate change, we are committed to the global climate agenda. Malawi’s own ambition is to cut carbon emissions by half before the year 2040, and we therefore call for support for our efforts to transition to clean and green energy.
On dealing with the evolving challenge of the coronavirus disease, Malawi is again ready to catch up. Crucial to that effort is obtaining access to vaccines, and members’ support to our efforts to catch up in that area will strengthen our vaccine-delivery systems in general.
However, the critical need for us is to strengthen health systems more broadly in order to build resilience against future pandemics, which calls for investment in health infrastructure and research. In that context, the news that six African States have been chosen to produce messenger RNA vaccines in Africa is music to my ears. I am proud of Malawi’s advocacy of that approach, as well as Malawi’s role as a co-pioneer of An Accord for a Healthier World, which was announced by Pfizer in Davos four months ago and aims to bring quality medicines to 1.2 billion people in low- income countries.
Those action-oriented partnerships are examples of the importance of Sustainable Development Goal 17 in the advancement of all other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We own the SDGs fully, and Malawi has so far undertaken two voluntary national reviews since 2020 in order to strengthen its national ownership of the SDGs. However, we see global private-public partnerships as essential to reclaiming the gains we have lost towards achieving the SDGs in the recent months of global crises.
It is because of our collaborative approach that we are on track to implement 60 per cent of the Goals. We are now in the process of reviewing the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for the period 2024 to 2028 so that it is responsive to national development plans, linked to the delivery of the SDGs. In that spirit of partnership, we also plan to make full use of the Doha Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2022-2031 in order to catch up even more on achieving the SDGs.
Speaking of LDCs, it is my pleasure as Chair to invite members to the fifth United Nations Conference on Least Developed Countries, to be held in Doha in March 2023, where even more partnerships will be forged around creating solutions for vulnerable countries.
One problem in desperate need of a solution for the most vulnerable LDCs is the unsustainable debt levels and distress they bear. It is not for nothing that the scriptures, which are regarded as sacred in more than half the world, describe unsustainable debt as a form of slavery. As leaders of generations past worked together to end old forms of slavery, we must also work together to end this new form.
Recently, the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund called on the world’s major lenders to show leadership by relieving vulnerable countries of the debts that shackle them, because even loans that were given and received in good faith have become unsustainable in the recent and current climate of relentless and unforeseen external shocks.
I therefore join her in reiterating that call and commend the People’s Republic of China for leading by example by fulfilling the pledge it made at last year’s Forum on China-Africa Cooperation to forgive interest- free loans owed by 17 African countries. Let that be the beginning of breaking the chains holding vulnerable countries back, not the end, because when we say that we are leaving no one behind, that is one way to put our money where our mouth is.
Let me hasten to add that, as President of a country that stands to benefit from debt-relief measures, I do not regard my country as entitled to such. In fact, I am fully committed to being held accountable for the responsible use of those lifejackets. I recognize that we must also prove ourselves worthy of such assistance by using it to cushion our citizens against the worsening financial volatility, trade cost and human suffering that debt and other external factors cause.
Indeed, there must be no Member State in our midst that is beyond scrutiny or exempt from accountability. For that to become a reality, United States President Biden’s recent call for the United Nations family to defend the rights of smaller nations as equals of larger ones must not only be applauded, but it must be uploaded.
As African Member States, we do not wish to gather here next year with no progress made on the African Union’s Ezulwini Consensus, which demands two permanent seats with veto power and five non-permanent seats for Africa. Following the strong
signal of support from the Government of the United States, we expect to see that matter on its way to the Security Council to be proposed, discussed and decided.
That is the United Nations we want. That is the United Nations the world needs — a reformed United Nations that practices the equality and democracy it preaches; a reformed United Nations that is not constantly polarized by nuclear Powers, stuck in Cold War mindsets; a reformed United Nations that uses its multilateral muscle to give equal attention to the interlocking issues of public health, food insecurity, climate change and conflict, regardless of where they emerge or whom they affect; a reformed United Nations that gives equal weight to all States Members that give it meaning, not just those that give it money. That is because we are one humankind, facing the same storm in the same boat.
In that spirit of one humankind, let me conclude by expressing my country’s deepest condolences to the British royal family and to the people and the Government of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth on the passing of Queen Elizabeth II, who was laid to rest on the eve of the Assembly’s high- level debate week.
I thank Mr. Csaba Korosi, President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session, for this opportunity, and I congratulate him on his election, as I wish outgoing President Abdulla Shahid the very best in his continued service to humankind and the cause of leaving no one behind."
Malaysia,MYS,Asia,"  31,528,000 ",22687,3.414999962,5.3,75.997,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Lower Respiratory Infection,1823,5.78,"  31,528,000 ",100.00,8.89,"First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session. I am confident that under his leadership, this session will be conducted with efficiency and effectiveness. I would also like to express my appreciation to the previous President, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for his excellent leadership of the seventy-sixth session in the face of various constraints and challenges.
Malaysia welcomes the theme chosen for this year’s session of the General Assembly, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”. We believe that the theme is most apt for the situation we are going through together. During the seventy-sixth session of General Assembly, we heard a high level of commitment and pledged to work together. That has given hope to the world. Numerous statements were issued, all inspiring hope, including in me, that the spirit of a world family would allow us to set aside our differences. That commitment enables us to rise from the pandemic and together overcome the challenges we face.
Even so, that spirit of optimism is fading. I am concerned by the challenges that remain unaddressed and are , in fact, deteriorating. Many challenges remain unresolved. A major lesson the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic taught us is that we cannot run from every challenge that confronts us. Being selfish and not caring about the impact on others will only generate mistrust in international cooperation.
In an interconnected world, the policies and decisions of some countries can affect others. For example, in addressing the current inflation around the world, one country’s monetary policy and control of interest rates has an impact on other countries. That is where cooperation and coordination among countries need to be stepped up if we are to achieve the goal of a more just economic well-being for all.
In an international financial and monetary structure that is still dominated by a few major Powers, and in the context of world economic recovery, domestic monetary decisions have to be adjusted by taking the reality and needs of developing countries into account. In that connection, Malaysia urges Member States to establish a cooperative international monetary mechanism to build a more effective and just system that is able to balance the needs of global development.
One truth that we should not forget is that conflicts have nothing but negative effects for the whole world. It is because of conflict that we are now facing various problems, such as lack of nutrients and food resources. In that regard, Malaysia calls on all countries to emphasize the issue of food security so as to guarantee sufficient food resources for all.
The United Nations Charter and international law are there to promote the peaceful settlement of disputes between countries. The Charter and the laws set the limits of a country’s pursuit of its own interests. Based on that principle, Malaysia opposes violations of international law, including the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity of any nation. When a conflict erupts, all parties have the responsibility to ease tension and prioritize the safety and lives of civilians. At the same time, the conflicting parties need to return to the negotiating table to stop the conflict as soon as possible.
Malaysia does not approve of the isolation of a country from international organizations. Such a measure is against the principle of multilateralism and hinders dialogue. The price to be paid for war is high. That is proven by the situation experienced by Ukraine. The effects are felt not only by the people and the country but also by the world. This conflict has threatened peace, global security and the economy, and undermined food security. Malaysia welcomes the creation of a sea corridor that allows for the shipment of grain from Ukraine. This is a positive step in addressing the food security problem. In that regard, Malaysia reiterates its insistence that all countries, especially the major Powers, refrain from creating isolation blocs that will only push the world towards a cold war. The world needs to realize that peace can be achieved only through dialogue and negotiation.
As for the occupied Palestinian territories, Malaysia is disappointed by the brutal occupation by Israel, which has been going on for a long time. The Palestinian people continue to live under the shackles of Israel’s discriminatory policies. Illegal settlements are becoming more widespread, in violation of international law, including Security Council resolution 2334 (2016). The most basic rights of the Palestinian people continue to be denied. Malaysia is therefore of the view that the major Powers need to be honest in resolving the issue of cruelty faced by the Palestinian people. The United Nations should take a firm stand to ensure that the longstanding crisis in Palestine is resolved quickly. Many countries today have been quick to act in the case of Ukraine. Malaysia wants the same action to be taken to resolve the issue of Palestine. Israel needs to stop being an apartheid entity!
Although we are still threatened by conflicts among countries, we cannot ignore other crises around the world. The pillar of strength for a conflict-free world is living together in a culture of peace. Malaysia, as a multiracial, multicultural and multireligious country, always supports and strives for the concept of peaceful coexistence among races, beliefs and cultures. Malaysia has played an important role in conflict resolution in South-East Asia. For example, Malaysia has been involved in the peace process between the Philippine Government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front since 2001. In addition, Malaysia has always been proactive in helping to resolve regional crises and conflicts.
However, Malaysia has been disappointed with the situation in Myanmar since the coup that took place in February 2021. It is very saddening that the Security Council has taken no serious action to deal with the situation. Some even see the Security Council as having washed its hands of the matter and handing it over to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Malaysia is disappointed that there has been no meaningful progress in the implementation of the ASEAN five-point consensus, especially on the part of the Myanmar junta. The ASEAN five-point consensus cannot continue any longer in its current form. It needs to be given a new lease of life and refined based on a clearer framework, time frame and end goal. Even more important is that the aspirations of the people of Myanmar must be fulfilled.
The political crisis in Myanmar has also aggravated the situation of millions of Myanmar refugees, including the Rohingya refugees. Although Malaysia is not a signatory to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol, it has accepted nearly 200,000 Rohingya refugees on humanitarian grounds. It is the responsibility of all countries, including those participating in the Convention, to welcome and resettle more refugees. At the same time, Malaysia strongly emphasizes the importance of the world’s addressing the root cause of the Rohingya crisis. I believe that this issue will not be resolved as long as the crisis in the country continues.
The conflicts and crises that occur in the world, including in Ukraine, Palestine and Myanmar, cannot be resolved due to the debility of the global governance system and the United Nations. The biggest problem in the United Nations is the Security Council. The power of veto is often misused to favour the world Powers that have it. It is not democratic and violates the principles of democracy. That makes it impossible for conflicts to be resolved by any of the permanent members of the Council. In line with the principle of one-country one-vote, now is the time to abolish the veto power. As an Organization that brings the spirit and symbol of democracy to the world, the United Nations needs to return to its foundations.
Climate change is a universal problem that affects us all. Last year alone, Malaysia was struck by the most serious floods in its history, resulting in losses estimated at $1.4 billion or 6.1 billion ringgit. Many lives were lost and almost 100,000 people had to be moved to temporary evacuation centres. That situation arose not only in Malaysia but in several other countries as well. Clearly, mitigation and adaptation measures need to continue. The fact remains that developed countries must bear the responsibility of increasing aid for developing countries by fulfilling their commitment to providing an unconditional yearly allocation of $100 billion. That will help realize the actions taken against climate change that should have been implemented since 2020.
COVID-19 has slowed our efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). I stand here as the representative of a developing country to assert that the implementation and success of a greener and more sustainable socioeconomic development will be achieved with a fair and inclusive response to that pledge. The fact is that new technology is an incentive for nations to switch to renewable energy. However, that new technology must first be affordable to developing countries. In that regard, Malaysia is committed to shouldering its responsibilities and roles to ensure environmental conservation and sustainability. Malaysia has undertaken various measures in that context. For example, in the palm oil industry, Malaysia has introduced the Malaysian sustainable palm oil standard to meet requirements for the purpose of sustainable development.
Malaysia is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent, based on gross domestic product, by 2030. In that regard, Malaysia has set a target of achieving 31 per cent renewable energy use by 2025. Malaysia is also committed to achieving its goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The national energy policy 2022-2040 was implemented in Malaysia on 19 September to build macroeconomic resilience and energy supply security. Malaysia has agreed to establish a National SDG Centre to intensify SDG programmes and monitor their progress.
As one of only 17 biodiverse countries in the world, Malaysia is aware of its responsibility to maintain and preserve its natural resources for future generations. During the Earth Summit in 1992, Malaysia pledged to maintain at least 50 per cent of its land mass under forest and tree cover. Three decades on, the entire Malaysian territory today remains 54 per cent forested. That percentage will increase following ongoing aggressive reforestation measures.
Not only Malaysia, but the entire world also needs to be more sensitive to efforts to achieve the Sustainable
Development Goals by 2030. In that regard, Malaysia welcomes the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, to be held next year. That effort is timely because it will give us the opportunity to look back at what has been achieved and what can be improved for the benefit of the world family.
We all share the same concerns on all the issues I have raised. Malaysia remains optimistic. I call on Member States to play their respective roles in overcoming the challenges we face. However, we have to do it together as one big family — the world family. United we stand; divided we fall. As long as we are united and strong together in shouldering this burden, I am sure we will succeed.
Today I invite the international community to work together by practicing the spirit of the world family in facing global challenges. Malaysia will continue to give its full commitment."
Mali,MLI,Africa,"  19,078,000 ",1604,7.910999775,4.4,58.893,Neonatal Disorder,Malaria,Cardiovascular Disease,806,4.22,"  9,646,107 ",50.56,2.58,"At the outset, I would like to discharge the pleasant duty of sharing with the General Assembly the warm greetings of the Malian people, who are rich in cultural, religious and ethnic diversity, as well as those of His Excellency Colonel Assimi Goita, President of the Transition and Head of State.
The election of Mr. Csaba Korosi to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session and the conclusion of the work of the seventy-sixth session of the General Assembly skilfully led by his predecessor Mr. Abdulla Shahid of the Republic of Maldives give me the happy opportunity to extend to them the warm congratulations of all of Mali. Allow me also to reiterate to our Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, our great appreciation for the commendable efforts he continues to make towards the realization of the noble objectives of our shared Organization. We are convinced that he is a friend of Mali and the Sahel.
Since friendship is based on sincerity, I would like to express my profound disagreement with his recent media appearance, during which he took a position and spoke on the case involving the 46 Ivorian mercenaries, which is a bilateral and judicial matter between two brotherly countries. It is obvious that the legal character of the offences arising from this case does not fall within the remit of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. In Mali, our Administration does not work on the basis of oral proceedings or press statements, and, accordingly, we scrupulously adhere to the note verbale issued by the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), contained in document MINUSMA/PROT/ NV/226/2022 of 22 July 2022, in which it is clear that there are no links between the 46 mercenaries and the United Nations. The recent alignment of actions and harmonization of terms intended to change the status of my country, Mali, from victim to culprit in this affair involving mercenaries, are obviously without effect.
As the Secretary-General’s position on the matter has been adopted by certain West African leaders, it is through him that we would send them messages. For example, to the current Chair of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Mr. Umaro Sissoco Embalo, who said,
“We have just seen the day before yesterday the
statement of the Secretary-General of the United
Nations, who said that they are not mercenaries.
If I were the Malians, I would have released these
49 soldiers”,
I would like to respectfully point out that while there is a principle of subsidiarity between ECOWAS and the United Nations, it is not clear cut, nor is it mimicry. It is also important to point out that the Secretary- General of the United Nations is not a Head of State, and that the Chair of ECOWAS is not a civil servant. It would therefore be appropriate for Mr. Guterres not to trivialize ECOWAS. Finally, it would be useful to remind the Chair of ECOWAS that in Mali, the authorities do not interfere in judicial matters and that they respect the independence of the judiciary. It is not our role, therefore, to arrest or release people, which is a judicial function.
In addition, Mr. Umaro Sissoco Embalo should be aware of the fact that he is the custodian of a daunting legacy and the numerous sacrifices that have made the reputation of ECOWAS. The momentum that has made the organization great must remain unbroken. Furthermore, we have noted the threat of sanctions against Mali, and, far from being afraid of sanctions, I would point out to the Chair of ECOWAS that, at the end of his term of office, the peoples of West Africa will judge him on the efforts he will have made to improve their living conditions, and not on the media shows that serve foreign agendas.
As to Mr. Bazoum, he should take note that the Malian transition Government did not react to his insulting remarks for two reasons. The first reason is the respect we have for the teaching of our ancestors that holds that one should not respond to insults with insults. The second reason is related to the identity of Mr. Bazoum, a foreigner who claims to be from the Niger. Because we know that the brotherly people of the Niger are distinguished by their very rich societal, cultural and religious values, Mr. Bazoum cannot be from the Niger; his behaviour makes us feel completely comfortable with this observation. Mali will draw all legal consequences from the actions of the Secretary- General.
We ask those who wish to refute our version to state, before God and on their soul and conscience, whether they would find it acceptable that military personnel who have concealed their identities by putting in their passports that they are painters, masons or the like disembark at their airports with weapons, without informing them in advance, and with the fateful intention of destabilizing their countries. If they as States do not find this acceptable, if it cannot be done in Lisbon or anywhere else, Mali as a State will not find its acceptable either, be it in Bamako or any other Malian locality.
The theme of this seventy-seventh ordinary session of the General Assembly — a watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges — will give hope for better days for Mali, provided that an uncompromising assessment of the previous era is made, lessons learned and objective recommendations made. Once these steps are taken, I have no doubt that through our collective action we will succeed not only in calming the multiple sources of tension in the world, but also in promoting harmonious development and effectively fighting against pandemics, environmental degradation and global
warming, inequalities and policies of domination and resource pillaging.
Since August 2020, my country, Mali, has been in a transition process, which will end on 26 March 2024, with the transfer of power to elected authorities. Between today and that date, and in accordance with the recommendations of the Assises nationales de la refondation, the transitional authorities have, in two timetables agreed with ECOWAS, committed themselves to carrying out political and institutional reforms, before organizing elections, the ultimate objective of which is to rebuild the Malian State, so that it can respond to the deep and legitimate aspirations of our people for peace, security, good governance, development and lasting institutional stability in Mali. With this perspective in mind, I am happy to point out that some major advances have already been made, in particular the promulgation of the electoral law, which includes, inter alia, the creation of the Independent Election Management Authority, whose establishment is at an advanced stage, as well as the setting up of a commission composed of eminent personalities from all components of Malian society, to be responsible for drafting the new Constitution.
On another level, few people know that Mali is the only country in the world in which there are four overlapping types of insecurity that occur simultaneously:	terrorism, community conflicts
manipulated by terrorists and their foreign-State sponsors, transnational organized crime, and the violent actions of isolated individuals. In parallel with the process of returning to constitutional order, Mali continues to wage a merciless struggle against the actors of insecurity, in particular extremist groups that are responsible for all sorts of abuses against our peaceful populations.
With respect to Mali, I am happy and proud to announce that the terrorist groups have been seriously weakened, and fear has even changed sides. However, these criminal groups retain a certain capacity to cause harm in their desperate attempts to undermine our territorial integrity and terrorize our populations.
Mali’s valiant defence and security forces remain determined to confront all threats from wherever they may come. Under the leadership of His Excellency Colonel Assimi Goita, President of the Transition and Head of State, the Government of Mali continues to intensify its efforts to recruit, train, equip and strengthen the operational capacities of the Malian defence and security forces. In this regard, I must say that the offensive actions carried out so far have enabled our forces to win decisive victories against the obscurantist forces. They have also enabled the State to regain its foothold in and reassert its authority over a large part of the national territory, as well as to encourage the return of several thousand of our compatriots to their places of origin.
However, we know that a purely military or security solution has its limits. That is why, in support of military action, the Government of Mali has adopted a comprehensive and integrated strategy that comprises political, social and development measures, including the provision of basic social services to our populations hard hit by the multifaceted crisis we have been experiencing since January 2012, with the objective of restoring the authority of the State throughout the national territory. In this context, the Government of Mali approved the national strategy for the stabilization of the central regions and its 2022- 2024 action plan on 24 August. This strategy reflects the desire of the transitional authorities to have a holistic approach to stabilizing the central regions. It aims to make the centre a stable and prosperous area where communities are reconciled and live in harmony with their neighbours. At the same time, the diligent and intelligent implementation of the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in Mali, which came out of the Algiers process, remains a strategic priority for the transitional authorities, as a peaceful instrument for a lasting resolution of the crisis that Mali is experiencing in its northern part.
I must say that I am particularly pleased with the outcome of the second decision-level meeting of the parties to the Agreement, held in Bamako from 1 to 5 August 2022. This important meeting, which brought together the signatory parties and international mediators, made it possible to remove certain obstacles to the relaunch of the Agreement implementation process.
Continuing this positive and progressive momentum in the peace process, the sixth high-level meeting of the Agreement Monitoring Committee was held in Bamako just a few weeks ago, on 2 September 2022. This session of the Monitoring Committee sent a strong signal of the parties’ willingness to engage in a new dynamic to complete the implementation of the Agreement. I would like to reaffirm our commitment to this process, the success of which remains one of the sine qua non conditions for lasting stability in Mali. This is the right time for me to thank Algeria once again for playing an active role in the peace process and to thank the international mediation team for its support.
I am not forgetting the situation of Malian refugees in neighbouring countries, which I thank in passing for their hospitality towards our people. Nor am I forgetting the situation of our internally displaced compatriots. I want to reassure them that the Government of Mali remains very attentive to their precarious situation and that all our efforts are aimed at creating the conditions for their return home in safety and dignity, with a view to their effective participation in the life of the nation.
In its difficult quest for peace, stability and sustainable development, the Malian people remain grateful for the efforts and sacrifices made by MINUSMA, from its creation in July 2013 to the present day, aimed at helping Mali restore its authority throughout its territory. That is why I would like to pay tribute, on behalf of the people and the Government of Mali, to the memory of all the victims, Malian and foreign, civilian and military, who have fallen on the field of honour in the country.
Nevertheless, we must recognize that almost 10 years after the establishment of the Mission, the objectives for which MINUSMA was deployed in Mali have not been achieved, and this, despite numerous resolutions of the Security Council. That is why the Government of Mali reiterates its often-expressed request for a change of paradigm: for MINUSMA to adapt to the environment in which it is deployed, and for it to be better coordinated with the Malian authorities. From this perspective, it is extremely important for MINUSMA to remain a support force for Mali in its quest for stability.
The Government of Mali denounces negative external influences and attempts to use certain entities legally present in the country to serve hidden agendas, including through the exploitation of the human rights issue for destabilization purposes.
The world will remember that Mali, after being abandoned midstream, on 10 June 2021, by France, which decided unilaterally to withdraw the Barkhane force from my country, was then stabbed in the back by the French authorities. This clarification is all the more useful since we refuse to confuse the French people, whom we respect, with their leaders. The French authorities, deeply anti-French for having denied universal moral values and betrayed the serious humanistic heritage of the philosophers of the Enlightenment, have turned into a junta in the service of obscurantism. I repeat: the French authorities, deeply anti-French for having denied universal moral values and betrayed the serious humanistic heritage of the philosophers of the Enlightenment, have turned into a junta in the service of obscurantism. I repeat one last time: the French authorities, deeply anti-French for having denied universal moral values and betrayed the serious humanistic heritage of the philosophers of the Enlightenment, have turned into a junta in the service of obscurantism.
The obscurantism of the French junta stems from its nostalgia for condescending, paternalistic and revanchist neo-colonial practices, including ordering the premeditated, unprecedented, illegal, illegitimate and inhuman sanctions against my country adopted by ECOWAS and the West African Economic and Monetary Union. After more than 10 years of insecurity resulting in thousands of deaths, refugees and internally displaced persons, is it not a sacrilege to put a Malian population that is a victim of insecurity in a landlocked country under embargo for seven months by closing the borders and seizing Mali’s financial accounts? Thanks to their resilience and the solidarity of friendly countries and peoples of Africa, the Malian people have held out and thwarted the predictions of their adversaries. The obscurantism of the French junta, which has so quickly forgotten its responsibility for the Tutsi genocide in Rwanda, has led to its guilt for instrumentalizing ethnic differences, and to it desperately trying to separate Malian children from each other and their families. Finally, this obscurantism of the French junta has caused it to violate Malian airspace by flying drones, military helicopters and fighter jets more than 50 times over that airspace, providing intelligence, weapons and ammunition to terrorist groups.
In order to ease its conscience, the French junta accuses Mali of being ungrateful for various counterterrorism operations, and revelling in the regrettable deaths of 59 French soldiers in Mali. In response to this sad accusation, we recall that in most of the official Malian statements and ceremonies, we systematically pay homage to all victims of insecurity in Mali, including the 59 deceased French soldiers, without making distinctions by nationality. Further, we invite the French not to stop there, but to take a look back at their history: their intervention in Libya decried
by all Africa, the forced participation of thousands of Africans in the First and Second World Wars, not to mention the slave trade, which explains the economic rise of many countries. How many Africans have died for France and the free world in which we live?
In view of serious acts committed by the French junta, Mali, in a letter dated 15 August 2022 (S/2022/622), requested an emergency meeting of the Security Council. The purpose of this meeting would be to allow my country to present the evidence it has gathered, which shows that the French army has repeatedly and frequently attacked Mali, violating its airspace without authorization from the authorities and sometimes falsified flight documents. More seriously, Mali will be able to prove that the French junta has provided intelligence and weapons to terrorist groups.
The Government of Mali wonders why this member of the Security Council, which currently holds the Council presidency, is blocking a debate that would establish the truth. The world needs to be informed about the serious events that have taken place in Mali, which are at the root of the worsening insecurity and destabilization of Mali and the Sahel.
By referring the matter to the Security Council, the Government of Mali intends to make this important body, which is endowed with the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security, face up to its responsibilities and denounce the French junta’s actions against my country. These hostile acts are incompatible with the United Nations Charter and with France’s status as a permanent member of the Security Council.
The credibility of the mechanisms of our shared Organization is it stake, as is the effectiveness of its fight against terrorism. But more importantly, the integrity of the United Nations, which is based on respect for international commitments, international legality and the United Nations Charter, inter alia, is at risk. It seems appropriate for Mali to request the personal involvement of the President of the General Assembly in calling upon the Security Council to grant our request, so that the duplicity and the proxy war imposed on my country may cease.
In its fight against terrorism and violent extremism, the Government of Mali has been confronted with difficult challenges in terms of human rights. I would like to emphasize that human rights are, more than any other, a value that every Malian embodies. The Government of Mali remains determined to respect human rights and ensure that human rights are respected, in accordance with its zero-tolerance policy against impunity. We adhere to this out of loyalty to our ancestral values enshrined in the 1236 Kouroukan Fouga Charter of Emperor Soundiata Keita. As a cradle of great civilizations, heir to great empires, a melting- pot land of hospitality and tolerance, Mali makes the promotion and defence of human rights a national priority, which is why I strongly reaffirm that the military operations of the Malian defence and security forces are conducted in strict compliance with human rights and international humanitarian law.
However, as I have just emphasized, the Government of Mali is vehemently opposed to the use of the issue of human rights for political purposes or posturing or blackmail or intimidation. Similarly, we regret the double standards that lead to the rights of populations whose entire villages have been massacred and razed hardly arousing any indignation, while communications are manipulated to pass off terrorists neutralized on the battlefield as innocent civilians.
In conclusion, I will say that the Malian people have decided to take their destiny into their own hands. They fully support the Government in rebuilding Mali and returning it to peaceful and secure constitutional order in March 2024, after free, transparent and credible elections. The realization of these vast projects requires the Government to extend and intensify its efforts aimed at continuously improving the security situation in the country and protecting the people and their property.
In this regard, I am pleased that the third Transition Support Group Meeting on Mali was held in Lome on 6 September. I am also pleased with this important meeting’s outcomes, in particular the recognition of the progress made by the transition authorities, the calls for the mobilization of all Mali’s partners to consolidate their political, economic, technical and financial support to the Republic of Mali, and the support voiced for the efforts of Mali’s transitional authorities to achieve a harmonious return to constitutional order.
I would like to remind the Assembly that the transition in Mali came as the result of several years of dysfunction in our young democracy, which nevertheless had achieved some positive results. Unfortunately, on balance, our liabilities were greater than our assets, which is what triggered the transition.
I would like to take this opportunity to warmly thank our respected elder, His Excellency Mr. Alassane Ouattara, President of the Republic of Cote d’Ivoire, for the wise and enlightened advice he gave us in his memorable address to the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session (see A/77/PV.7). I would like to reassure him that the Malian transitional authorities have no other objective than to carry out political and institutional reforms before organizing elections, while doggedly fighting terrorism. These reforms will improve governance, and all measures will be taken to make Mali’s democracy the most envied in the world.
In those efforts, we will pay particular attention to the issue of the “third term”, which will be excluded as a possibility in our country. The “third term”, for those who are unfamiliar with the concept, consists of the president of a republic carrying out a four-step manoeuvre to retain power for himself and his clan. It works as follows.
The first stage occurs near the end of a president’s second term. Because term limits make him ineligible for re-election, the outgoing president calls for a constitutional revision in a non-consensual manner. In the second stage, that of constitutional revision, the outgoing president modifies some constitutional provisions. In the third stage, once the new Constitution has been adopted — against the background of a political crisis, of course — the outgoing president now becomes a candidate, in violation of the two-term limit. His candidacy is now justified by the adoption of the new Constitution under the obvious pretext that the two-term limit was contained in the old Constitution, while the outgoing president is a candidate under the newly adopted Constitution. The fourth stage involves the organization of elections, which are a farce. Naturally, the outgoing president wins the election. A ruthless hunt for political opponents ensues. Some of them are arrested, others go into exile and still others are murdered. Allegiances are won through the power of money, patronage and intimidation.
I would simply state, using a soccer metaphor, that the third term is a magic trick: it is the art of dribbling past one’s opponents while keeping the ball.
President Ouattara’s advice reminds us of the sad story of the camel mocking the hump of the dromedary.
Despite the tangible efforts of the Malian transition to implement the timetables for the political and institutional reforms and elections that have been hailed by the international community, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the French junta, from whom Mali has not asked for a single thing, considered there to have been no progress, forgetting that no one can love Mali more than the Malians themselves. Her singular position, adverse to us, hardly surprises us. Victor Hugo in “Claude Gueux” classified the human race into two categories:
“There are men who are metal, and there are men
who are lodestones.”
The Minister in question, unfortunately, is neither metal nor lodestone; she is hideously sui generis.
Faced with uncertainty and strange situations, the Malian people adopt an attitude of prudence. In The Strange Fate of Wangrin, writer and sage Amadou Hampate Ba advised that:
“If the ability to observe is a quality, knowing how
to be silent can save a person from calamity”.
Mali advises the Minister of the French junta to be content with simply observing her situation.
This is an opportunity for me to salute the exemplary and fruitful cooperative relations Mali has with Russia, while reaffirming that Mali remains open to all partners that wish to help it meet the multiple challenges besetting it, in strict respect for its sovereignty and unity and of the dignity of the Malian people.
Mali recalls that, in line with the vision of Colonel Assimi Goita, President of the Transition and Head of State, three principles guide national public action: first, respect for the sovereignty of Mali; secondly, respect for the strategic choices and partners of Mali; and thirdly, consideration of the vital interests of the Malian people in the decisions taken.
In implementing those principles, Mali remains willing to pursue and strengthen its good-neighbourly relations with all the countries around it. Similarly, faithful to its pan-African commitment, Mali will continue to work within subregional and regional organizations to bring about African integration. Also, achieving the objectives of the transition requires the support of all Mali’s partners, including the United Nations. I therefore appeal to Mali’s friends to stand by the Government in order to help it to meet those important challenges together.
As for the vast majority of the world’s States, convinced by mutual respect and the win-win partnership, I guarantee that Mali’s doors are wide open to them, and Malians will welcome them with open arms. For the minority that may be tempted not to respect those principles, we promise them that they will be met by millions of Assimi Goita supporters, anxious to preserve their honour, their dignity and their vital interests.
I will conclude by giving two pieces of advice to those that are nostalgic for domination. They should have a sense of empathy by treating others as they would like to be treated and not doing to others what they would not want done to them. The second piece of advice is to review their work, revise their models, adjust their mindsets to reflect the change in attitudes and the evolution of the world into their assessment and analysis grids, move on from the colonial past, hear the anger, frustration and opposition coming from African cities and rural areas and African peoples and understand that that trend is inevitable. Thanks to the principle of fractional multiplication, their intimidation and disruptive actions have only swelled the ranks of Africans anxious to preserve their dignity. If there were only 100 of us at independence, today there are millions, and tomorrow, as long as the unequal patterns remain, there will be billions. Mali and its people will not be bystanders in the face of attacks and adversity. For every word used wrongly, we will respond by reciprocating; for every bullet fired against us, we will respond by reciprocating.
Only then will a new era become a reality, with solutions that bring about change to address interrelated challenges through interdependent States and by valuing humankind, without distinction of any kind, in particular with regard to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, as stipulated in article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
May God bless Mali and protect Malians from the dark and destructive forces of the world. May God bless Africa and protect Africans from the obscurantist and destructive forces of the world. May God bless the world and protect all humankind from the dark and destructive forces of the world."
Malta,MLT,Europe,"  439,000 ",27612,4.010000229,6.9,82.376,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,27,6.15,"  439,000 ",100.00,10.19,"The theme for this General Assembly is indeed an appropriate one, for this truly is a watershed moment. As I was preparing for my address today, I thought to myself, “What is it that the people we represent want most? What do they expect of their leaders?” The answer is peace, equality and prosperity. Every person wants to live in peace, to be free and equal, and to have a decent quality of life. Those are the three themes that I would like to focus on today. All three are equally important, interlinked and go hand in hand. This institution should be focusing on delivering on them through concrete actions rather than words. For far too long, I would say, world leaders have allowed disparities to grow in this world, whether between the rich and the poor; between those who have access to fundamental rights and needs such as health care, water, food, and technology and those who are deprived of even the most basic needs; and between those with different sexual orientations. Peace, equality and prosperity are what we as world leaders should aspire to deliver to our people, to the world and to future generations — that is, if we truly want to make a positive difference in their lives.
I want to start by discussing peace. Peace builds, restores and strengthens. Without peace, security and stability, we will never be able to focus on the more important challenge we face, which is bringing about growth, equality and prosperity. That is what Malta and its people stand for. It is what our predecessors had in mind when they enshrined in our Constitution the words “Malta is a neutral State actively pursuing peace, security and social progress among all nations”. That declaration of principles is also echoed in the core values and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, which we should all be committed to upholding. Today, peace is threatened by what Secretary-General Guterres rightly referred to as the cauldron of crises in which we find ourselves. And if we do not come together to work for a global order and world peace, we do not stand a chance, for no single State can do it alone.
In 1989, Malta played an important role in bringing an end to the Cold War by hosting the Bush-Gorbachev summit. Today we remain more committed than ever to contributing to the re-establishment and maintenance of world peace, order and security. As an island State in the Mediterranean, we have seen first-hand the effects of conflicts in our southern area. For more than a decade, those conflicts have led to instability,
with wars and violence causing irreparable harm in Libya, Syria and Yemen, which in turn also led to mass migration. Equally tenuous are the situations in the Sahel, Afghanistan and the Middle East. Naturally, at this moment in time, the most prominent is the war in Ukraine. Following decades of peace in mainland Europe, it is a stark reminder that peace can never be taken for granted.
Thousands of civilians have been killed and millions are suffering devastating losses. Close to 12.8 million people are estimated to have been displaced in Ukraine, which is a third of its population and constitutes the largest human displacement crisis in the world today. The international community cannot afford to lose sight of any of these situations. Our sustained support is urgently required to address the humanitarian needs they create and put an end to the devastation in order to end the suffering of innocent civilians.
Let us not underestimate the effects of the war. A failure to act will also cause instability to spill over into neighbouring regions with all of its negative consequences, including mass migration, human trafficking and terrorism. Yet as the war rages on in Ukraine, we must not forget the other issues that require our attention and action. I would like to speak briefly about our brothers and sisters in Northern Africa, particularly in Libya — a country that is a neighbour to Malta. Under the auspices of the United Nations and without interference from foreign actors, I believe that Libya and its people can transition to more peaceful, secure, stable and prosperous times. For that to happen, however, decisions must be taken to immediately put aside vested interests in Libya once and for all. That is what the Libyan people deserve and what is best not just for their region but for the Mediterranean area and the African continent in general.
We are indeed living in trying times as a result of these wars. Despite our efforts, equality remains a remote concept. Today’s global food supplies and energy markets have been shaken as never before, mostly because of the war in Ukraine. The knock-on effects will be felt by our peoples in different ways. Right now, they are taking the shape of constraints in the purchase of grains, fertilizers, agricultural equipment and livestock feed, shortages of which have inflated the prices of key basic imports. That in turn has negatively affected the purchasing power of consumers around the world. That continuing rise in the rate of inflation on food products, as well as in food scarcity and insecurity, is a major cause for concern and should be at the top of our agenda. Those pressures have an even more intense effect on small islands such as my country, owing to their insularity and other specificities. In Malta’s case, we took a calculated strategic decision to support and stand behind our people all the way to the best of our ability. If we do not support our people until the situation improves, we will have failed them. We cannot leave them to carry the burdens alone.
At the same time, we must bear in mind that if the situation is prolonged, it will lead to increased pressures on economic, social and environmental sustainability for us all. It is our duty, as citizens of a global, interconnected world, to work for more sustainable food systems, fulfilling our commitment to achieving zero hunger. But in order to end hunger, we must also end conflict and war. The right to food is a recognized basic human right. The consequences of not acting to safeguard it, compounded with the devastation caused by climate change, will be severe and could lead to famine and the further displacement of peoples. The number of people globally living in poverty is estimated to have risen by more than 70 million so far. With the probability of further marked increases in the coming months, that is something we cannot afford.
We appeal for the United Nations to address the global needs for resilience, as a counterpart and counterbalance to the dynamics of globalization and as a matter of urgent priority. In that regard, my country is a firm believer in international fair trade as a key element in the development of nations and something that is particularly important for smaller economies, which are largely dependent on external supply and demand for economic growth and increased social well-being. The pandemic has severely slowed the historical decline in the poverty rate. Food insecurity and price hikes will exacerbate the plight of millions around the world, as the effects of the war in Ukraine could continue to push the number of people at risk of falling below the poverty line even higher.
In the twenty-first century we will not find solutions through the use of force or weapons. We can prevent a further deterioration of the situation only if we manage to resolve war through dialogue and meaningful negotiation efforts. The twenty-first century should not be an era of war. The quest for peace requires that all who are parties to conflict put the best interests and priorities of the people first. We all know what the best interests of our peoples are. Our absolute priority should be to re-establish peace and order and to end war. That is what our people are telling us they
want, and it is what they deserve, so that is what we must deliver to them, without any further delay. We have all experienced almost three years of continued crisis, including a pandemic. The most vulnerable in our societies are the ones who have been the hardest hit. Social unrest will increase if our peoples’ quality of life deteriorates. That is why we must intensify our pursuit for peace, equality and justice for all. Malta will continue to stand with the people of Ukraine as they continue to face an unprovoked aggression. We will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians and condemn all tactics and recent statements that do not bode well and will most probably mean a further deterioration of the situation.
The third theme I want to delve into is prosperity. Economic resilience is now more important than ever. Only through economic ties and interdependence and the freedom of movement of people and capital across countries can we hope for long-lasting world peace. For decades, globalization has been hailed as the next frontier of economic growth, by enabling human, financial and capital resources to be deployed as effectively as possible; by fostering jobs — or rather, careers — through international trade; by creating wealth through technological advances and their dissemination; and by allowing for better diversification against risk through the creation of multiple investment opportunities. Our time is now, and if not now, when? Let us turn the challenges we face into opportunities to transform our economies and make them future-ready, and to focus on our green objectives. It is imperative that during these trying times we avoid any temptation to put the climate on the back-burner. We should make no mistake — the future is green, and it is digital.
I will focus on the latter first. The digital arena is one that Malta has recognized and embraced. We have invested heavily in our digital economy, both in terms of public administration and on the business and social fronts. Today we rank first in the European Union (EU) in terms of e-Government and fifth on the EU Digital Economy and Society Index. That is no coincidence. It is the result of our strategic vision on digitalization. Our priority is always to keep our citizens at the heart of our policies and to strive to improve their quality of life, on multiple levels, by providing excellent, quality services, increasing the number of high-quality jobs, and reducing the digital divide to avoid leaving anyone behind where the use of technology is concerned. Digital is the future, and we are committed to it. 
In parallel with the digital transition, we have to work on the green one. In both areas, we must continue emphasizing the importance of closing the digital gap across all nations in order to ensure a level playing field. The displacement of peoples due to climate change, particularly as a result of droughts and sea-level rise leading to loss of territory, is unfortunately taking place on our watch. Though no one is safe from climate change, it is those who are most vulnerable who are the worst affected. In Pakistan floods have already claimed thousands of lives. And what about the heatwaves and droughts in China, California, the Middle East, Africa and Asia? What about the cyclones and typhoons in Japan? All of those are climate disasters that happened in 2022 but may become the order of the day if we do not intensify our efforts. There is no quick fix — far from it. Here I must reiterate that global challenges require global solutions. Together, we must keep the 1.5°C target alive, ensure that no one is left behind, and continue working to build decarbonized nations and societies.
As my country is about to proudly embark on a two-year term on the Security Council, we intend to do our utmost to keep climate change on the international peace and security agenda. Climate change poses a serious threat to us all, but particularly to small island developing States and many coastal communities. It threatens State sovereignty, leads to loss of territory and damages States’ infrastructure, as well as jeopardizing their existing rights under maritime zone boundaries. As Prime Minister of Malta, I am fully aware of the threat that climate change poses to small island States all over the world. No matter how near to or far we are from one another, we truly share similar climate challenges. Malta was one of the founding members of the Alliance of Small Island States and aims to become a leader in small island State governance. A lot has already been done in recent years. Malta has been channelling overseas development aid for decades now and we are committed to continuing to offer support through scholarships and dedicated learning and training programmes in various areas. One such area is water management. Water scarcity is becoming one of the most serious effects of climate change. Our water-management practices, particularly sourcing water through desalination and wastewater recycling, can serve as a model for addressing our world’s future needs, especially in view of the increasing recurrence of droughts brought about by climate change.
Moreover, small States may serve as platforms where innovative ideas and technologies can be tested and eventually identified as international best practices and adopted on a wider scale. Malta launched an initiative for islands at the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention on Climate Change in Glasgow last year, and we intend to continue to build on it further. Our aim is to bring to the fore the realities of small island economies as we strive to decarbonize, digitalize and fulfil the Sustainable Development Goals. Safeguarding our oceans therefore remains one of our key priorities. The interplay between climate change and the health of our ocean is important for Malta as we draw on our maritime legacy and our historical contribution at the United Nations. The ocean plays a pivotal role in combating climate change but is itself also vulnerable to the effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels and changes in sea temperature and currents. That is why as a member of the Security Council we will place particular emphasis on bridging the gap between science, policy and law-making in order to address global security concerns, especially with regard the ocean, as the single largest habitat on our planet.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank members for placing their trust and confidence in my country to serve on the Security Council for a two- year term starting in January 2023. As a proud State member of the European Union, located between two continents, we are committed to promoting dialogue and understanding with a view to strengthening cooperation and social progress. While the challenges we face are many, if we work together and concentrate our efforts I am sure that there are no obstacles we cannot overcome. Through cooperation and exchange, we will be able to see our societies grow and thrive. Now is the time for nations to reach out, deepen ties with existing partners and develop new relationships with others. As a State Member of the United Nations and a member of the Security Council starting next year, Malta stands ready to work with other Member States to maintain and encourage international peace and dialogue and to find transformative solutions to today’s challenges by fostering peace, strengthening equality and delivering prosperity, keeping security, sustainability and social justice at the heart of our efforts and priorities.
I would like to conclude by conveying a message that my 10-year-old daughter, Giorgia Mae, who is here with us in the audience, asked me to pass on when I explained to her that I would be addressing this meeting of world leaders. She said, “Papa, I would like the world leaders to be an example to us children and leave behind a beautiful Earth”. May that simple yet poignant message enable us to deliver what is expected of us."

I would like to convey to the General Assembly his sincere appreciation and wishes for its success.
I am also pleased to warmly congratulate His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session and to wish him every success in leading this session, which has adopted the theme “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”.
I commend His Excellency Mr Abdullah Shahid on his highly competent leadership of the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session. My country would like to express our appreciation and respect to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his diligent efforts to promote and advance the goals of the United Nations.
The current session is being held in a very challenging global environment, including the war in Ukraine, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, diverse terrorist threats and the threats of natural disasters caused by climate change. Indeed, the range of crises in the world today and their economic, social and humanitarian repercussions are unprecedented. They represent a major challenge at all levels, particularly in terms of global food insecurity. It is therefore only natural that such difficult conditions have more severe and dangerous consequences for developing countries, owing to their vulnerability and lack of resilience.
The war in Ukraine rages at a time when the world has not yet recovered from the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has resulted in disruptions to both fuel and food supply chains, leading to a staggering increase of commodity prices in general. Without the commendable efforts of the United Nations, Tiirkiye and other concerned parties, which led to an important agreement on resuming grain and fertilizer exports through safe corridors, the world would have faced an even greater catastrophe.
However, we are of the view that the measures taken by the international community are insufficient. We therefore call today for increased efforts to find solutions that will ensure peace, security and a dignified life for all the peoples of the world, which as the Assembly knows are the very purposes for which the United Nations was established.
From this rostrum, my country, the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, calls on the international community to assume its responsibilities towards developing and poor countries and to help them quickly confront the challenges that threaten their food security and contain the damage caused by those challenges. In that context, we reiterate our call for the cancellation of the external debt of countries in the African continent.
The gap is widening day by day between two worlds — one of which has entered the fourth industrial revolution while the other is still suffering from ignorance, poverty and terrorism under the yoke of backwardness. That calls on us to think carefully, and in a collective way, about finding appropriate ways to address the challenges of our times and maintain the spirit of humanity. Therefore, it is worth recalling that paradox and reflecting on it in this major international meeting, which is being held under the slogan of “solidarity, sustainability and science”. It also constitutes an opportunity to assess the efficacy of the adopted approaches and plans to meet common challenges.
Allow me in this regard to briefly mention my country’s efforts to establish the foundations of the rule of law and good governance, consolidate social cohesion, rehabilitate people and preserve their dignity and health as a way of creating the conditions for national renaissance and of overcoming obstacles to progress and prosperity.
Our country has taken important steps on the path to perpetuating the values of equality and justice; promoting democracy and individual and collective freedoms, including freedom of the press; adopting dialogue and consultation as a method for managing public affairs; and actively involving civil society in development strategies. It has also enshrined the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary, and enabled Parliament to fully exercise its oversight and accountability role. Transparency has been adopted in the conduct of public affairs, the exploitation of national wealth and the development of legal and regulatory mechanisms that guarantee the eradication of corruption and bribery. Our country has also strengthened efforts to protect and promote human rights by combating new forms of slavery and human trafficking.
With regard to strengthening social cohesion, my country’s Government, guided by His Excellency the President of the Republic, Mr. Mohamed Ould Cheikh El Ghazouani, has implemented important programmes to consolidate national unity and support and do justice to poor and vulnerable groups. These include exercising control over the prices of basic materials, ensuring their ongoing supply to the market and preventing speculation, in addition to covering medical insurance for 15 per cent of the population as a first step towards covering all of them.
Moreover, our country is providing the necessary assistance to more than 85,000 refugees from the sister Republic of Mali in the Ambra camp in south-eastern Mauritania, in cooperation with the relevant United Nations representations accredited in Mauritania.
Within the framework of investing in human capital, extensive programmes have been prepared to train and rehabilitate young people, enable them to enter the labour market and protect them from extremism. The empowerment of women and their strong participation in political life and the conduct of public affairs have also been enhanced. In the same context, our country has embarked on a promising reform process for our educational system, based on an accurate diagnosis of its deficiencies. All components of the educational community and stakeholders in the country have participated in its preparation, along with specialists.
In the field of health care, our country has redoubled its efforts to care for the citizens’ health by expanding and improving the supply of health services and ensuring access to high-quality medicines, all at a time when serious efforts are being made to strengthen and diversify the national economy and make it more resilient and able to withstand shocks and emergency crises.
Our country, Mauritania, has been keen to develop a comprehensive approach to combating terrorism and various forms of extremism that takes the security, ideological, economic and social dimensions into account. In that context, we have worked with our regional and international partners to intensify consultation and coordination in its implementation, with all due respect for human rights. As an embodiment of this vision, we consider the Group of Five for the Sahel to be an indispensable framework for confronting terrorism and achieving balanced and comprehensive development in the region. Therefore, we call for it to be supported in its efforts to overcome the obstacles currently in its path.
In the field of the environment and sustainable development, our country is focused on renewable energies. The percentage of clean energy has reached 40 per cent of the total energy we consume, and efforts are continuing to raise that percentage to achieve the set goals. In this field, Mauritania is working hard to benefit from its enormous natural capacities, represented by an abundance of wind and sunlight, to produce green hydrogen in a way that supports local industries and serves the country’s economic and social development.
We have also achieved important results in our efforts to stop desertification and rehabilitate the areas damaged by it, as well as to rationalize the exploitation of our marine resources and restore the biodiversity of our ecosystem. In that context, my country has high hopes for the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Sharm El-Sheikh in the sisterly Arab Republic of Egypt in November, and looks forward to the industrialized countries honouring their commitments to reducing emissions and the pledges they made at the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
My country, Mauritania, reiterates its ongoing support for just causes throughout in the world. We stress from this rostrum our adherence to the right of the Palestinian people to dignity and sovereignty within the framework of an independent State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, in accordance with the Arab Peace Initiative and relevant resolutions. We reiterate our condemnation of the continuing Israeli violations of human rights in Palestine and the other Arab territories.
We reaffirm our resolve to strive seriously to reach a political solution that preserves the unity and independence of the sisterly Syrian Arab Republic, the dignity of its people and their right to live in security and peace.
We reiterate our support for legitimacy in brotherly Yemen and call for the pursuit of a peaceful solution, in accordance with Arab initiatives and relevant international resolutions.
We reiterate our firm position on the conflict in Western Sahara and our support for the efforts of the United Nations and all relevant Security Council resolutions aimed at finding a solution sustainable and acceptable to all.
We call for a solution that preserves the unity and sovereignty of the sisterly State of Libya, and support international efforts in this regard.
We reiterate our support for efforts to restore the constitutional status in the sisterly Republic of Mali.
We express our concern over the continuation of the war in Ukraine, and we call on the relevant parties to come to the negotiating table in order to find a solution that will end the war and spare the region and the world further tragedies and destruction."
Mauritius,MUS,Africa,"  1,267,000 ",18852,7.130000114,5.9,74.863,Cardiovascular Disease,Diabetes,Neoplasm,120,9.47,"  1,262,713 ",99.66,9.41,"At the outset, let me congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session. I wish to assure him of the full cooperation of my delegation in the fulfilment of his important duties.
We are at a watershed moment in human history, when humankind is facing interlocking challenges that threaten peace, increase the level of poverty and are likely to considerably delay the achievements of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). At this particular session, the President’s proposed motto — “Solutions through solidarity, sustainability and science” — can provide us with some transformative solutions to address them. Multilateralism continues to be under threat, yet there is no other body or entity more representative and likely to strengthen global cooperation than the United Nations.
After the past three years of reeling from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, we were hoping that the availability of vaccines against COVID-19 would stop bleeding our economy and that we would return to normalcy. Instead, the situation has worsened due to the conflict in Europe, which is having far and wide ramifications around the world.
Conflicts and political instability have led to more crises and the human tragedy of war has worsened. Their profound economic impact is slowing growth and exacerbating the cost-of-living crisis. There is uncertainty as to when and how the conflict will end, but what is clear is that the massive influx of funds needed for recovery and reconstruction will necessarily draw from the much-needed assistance to countries seeking to recover from COVID-19. Millions of people will continue to suffer worldwide, and millions more will be left behind.
While we are still confronting an uneven recovery of the global economy, the pandemic recovery gap between countries is widening, creating economic and social reverberations around the globe and injecting more uncertainty into global markets. The rising cost of commodities and energy and, in some cases, their scarcity will further weaken our economies and delay the achievement of the SDGs. Small island developing
States (SIDS) like Mauritius, which are highly vulnerable, will be particularly affected. We make an urgent appeal to all players and the international community as a whole to work towards a cessation of hostilities and seek to resolve differences through peaceful means. This is the time when we should be seriously thinking of saving our planet, slowing down the effects of climate change, preventing a worldwide recession and, most importantly, preventing a nuclear catastrophe.
We are witnessing more and more extreme weather events; higher-than-ever temperatures, droughts, fires and floods are creating unprecedented challenges across the globe and taking a heavy toll on human life and material damage. I take this opportunity to express my Government’s sympathies and solidarity to the populations affected throughout the world, especially in Pakistan.
The twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change gives us another chance to globally agree on and commit to yet unprecedented measures to keep the temperature rise below the 1.5°C target. Our responsibilities as leaders and our state responsibility should guide us in ensuring that our own future and that of our children are secure and refrain from any action that is tantamount to ecocide.
Access to climate finance is essential to addressing these existential threats. Mauritius is keen to implement its nationally determined contributions which are estimated to cost around $6.5 billion. Despite the huge costs to our economy, Mauritius has pledged to finance 35 per cent of the projects. We appeal to the international community to support us for the remaining part.
The financing needs for development projects in SIDS like Mauritius should be demand-driven and based on the prevailing economic conditions, especially in light of the budgeting stress created by the pandemic. We must also address the inequities and, in that respect, the United Nations development systems, together with our development partners, should use a unified compass and a refined and more comprehensive vulnerability index that accurately captures the vulnerabilities of SIDS so as to prioritize allocation of funds and increase the funding of development activities.
Ocean-based economies are being deeply affected. Restoring the health of our oceans is crucial to preserving our biodiversity, community livelihoods and climate resilience. Negotiations for a binding global treaty to end plastic pollution and the consensus reached on banning harmful fisheries are important steps in the right direction to turn the tide and make our oceans healthy for our sustainable development.
Mauritius is committed to protecting our oceans and, in this context, it announced during the Lisbon Ocean Conference the creation of a marine protected area around the Chagos Archipelago. We invite States, non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders to support this initiative and assist in the creation, management and enforcement of the marine protected area which, will be among the largest in the world.
The world is getting increasingly connected digitally and cyberspace is invading almost all areas of modern day-life. However, while it is providing new opportunities, it is also creating new challenges. The pandemic has brought to light the role of information and communications technology as a crucial enabler of economic and social development, but we need to be cautious about the misuse and abuse of this technology as well.
Mauritius’ socioeconomic vision and multicultural and societal values take into account and encourage the pursuit of a secure, and safe digital world for all as we strive to undermine disinformation with accurate information. We strongly value respect for and the promotion of human rights, both online and offline. We are equally keen to protect human values, promote tolerance and avoid hate speech. In this respect, we support the efforts of the international community to elaborate a comprehensive international convention on countering the use of information and communications technology for criminal purposes.
The implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in its totality is to the benefit of all, for today’s and future generations. Mauritius strongly believes that we must address the concerns of our Youth for the future. Even though we are constrained by our insularity and limited means, we are striving to increase opportunities for our youth. Providing social protection and promoting social justice remains a key priority of our Government. Despite very difficult economic challenges, we are maintaining our social welfare State, inter alia, by providing free health coverage, free education and basic pension to the elderly.
The economic empowerment of women is at the heart of various policies that we have adopted in Mauritius. Our Government programme is paving the way for a society where gender equality is adhered to, ensuring fairness and equity among all, as well as the human and social development of women. In this respect, Mauritius has made significant progress towards achieving gender equality.
We reaffirm our full solidarity with the Palestinian People and strongly condemn the senseless acts of violence against its vulnerable population.
The recent development on the world scene is again pointing to the need for us to improve our ability to respond to crises, be they manmade or natural. In this regard, we believe that the United Nations system, particularly the Security Council, needs the necessary reforms to make it more representative of the world today and thereby render it more effective. In that regard, we again reiterate the importance of expanding the Security Council with members of the African continent, based on the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, as well as a member from SIDS, amongst others.
The fundamental pillars of the United Nations, such as development, human rights and international peace and security, are grounded in respect for and the promotion of international law. This essential bond among States enables the rule of law and global good governance to flourish, without which there would be chaos. When the United Nations and the institutions that we have created to uphold international law are not respected, democratic governance and our universal values are undermined. International Law cannot be applied selectively. It is universal, indivisible and essential to promote multilateralism, international cooperation and strengthen faith in a fair and equitable global order.
The Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice of 25 February 2019, resolution 73/295 and the Judgment of the Special Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea of 28 January 2021 have confirmed, with crystal clarity that international law, recognizes the Chagos Archipelago to be and to have always been an integral part of the territory of Mauritius. Yet, despite the aforementioned resolution, which required the colonial administration to withdraw within six months of the date of its adoption, that part of our territory remains occupied today. This situation further delays the implementation of our resettlement programme, especially for those Mauritians of Chagossian origin who were forcibly removed from there in the 1960s.
It ill behoves the United Kingdom to call on Mauritius and other African countries to respond to other allegations of illegal occupation when it is illegally occupying a part of Africa. The new Government of the United Kingdom has an opportunity to place itself on the right side of history and bring to a close this dark chapter of history involving the last colony in Africa and the last colony it ever created, as well as the shameful forcible displacement of people. Such a move would be fully consistent with the values and principles of the beloved late monarch, who we honour today and pay homage to.
What more fitting tribute could there be to the memory of that great monarch who dedicated her life to service and to upholding the values of democracy, human rights and international law, sovereignty and territorial integrity than to bring this history to an end and to do so in a manner that respects sovereignty, matters of security, environment and the fundamental rights of human beings? We urge the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to act with statesmanship and work with us to implement resolution 73/295 and support the completion of the decolonization of Mauritius and the resettlement of the former inhabitants of the Chagos Archipelago.
I wish to report that there have indeed been some attempts to start such a conversation. We reached a point where it would have been possible to agree on a way forward, but it appears that the United Kingdom is having some difficulty in accepting the proposal that any final agreement must be based on international law. It would be most disappointing if the ability to reach a final settlement were scuppered by its unwillingness to express a commitment to respecting the international rule of law — all the more so that Mauritius has over the years confirmed that it is prepared to enter into a long-term lease to protect the continued operations of the military base on Diego Garcia, given its contribution to regional peace and security.
Mauritius is deeply grateful for the support it has been receiving from other countries and for actions taken by international and regional organizations, including the United Nations and its specialized agencies, to implement resolution 73/295. We are particularly thankful to the United Nations for amending its world map to include the Chagos Archipelago as a part of
Mauritius; to the Universal Postal Union for ceasing to recognize the so-called British Indian Ocean Territory issued stamps; to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations for upholding the International Court of Justice Advisory Opinion and the General Assembly resolutions; and to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea for proceeding to delimit the maritime boundary between Mauritius and Maldives in the region of the Chagos Archipelago.
I must, however, deplore the decision of the North Indian Ocean Hydrographic Commission, which, at its latest meeting, held in Bali, violated its legal obligations by failing to recognize the legal entitlement of Mauritius, which satisfies all the criteria for full membership of that organization. In that regard, it is with much regret that Mauritius has decided to suspend its participation in future activities of the North Indian Ocean Hydrographic Commission until its legal entitlement to full membership of that regional organization is fully recognized.
With regard to Tromelin, which also forms an integral part of the territory of Mauritius, we look forward to the early resolution of the dispute over that island in the spirit of friendship that characterizes the relations between Mauritius and France.
We have reached a once in a generation moment and we must make critical choices that will determine our future. The vicious cycles of violence must stop; divides and distrust must end. We should not allow the winds of discord to draw the iron curtain closed again; the winds of peace should flow smoothly. Humankind’s aspirations and yearnings for peace are resonating strongly on the world stage. Current geopolitical tensions should be de-escalated. It is time for decisive action and stronger international cooperation. More than ever, the promise to leave no one behind must guide our actions and forward path.
It is only by working together that we can begin to weave a stronger and more inclusive global economy and build a better world for our shared prosperity. We can and we must act now."
Mexico,MEX,North America,"  126,191,000 ",15803,3.420000076,6.5,74.992,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Chronic Kidney Disease,6772,5.37,"  125,433,856 ",99.40,8.82,"I share the warm greetings of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and the entire population of Mexico.
In 2022, we are facing one of the most serious crises in recent times, which has had an impact on the global order, international peace and security, the economy, the supply of basic commodities and essential services. Humanitarian assistance needs have multiplied, inequality has unfortunately grown, and the negative effects of climate change have also increased. In addition to health security, which has been weakened by the pandemic, there is a serious threat posed to food security for large segments of the populations in the poorest and most marginalized countries. Furthermore, the current situation is marked by an increase in geopolitical tensions among the major Powers.
Just as it seemed that we were recovering from the grave effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the war in Ukraine erupted, bringing with it the risk of a nuclear accident and its potentially catastrophic consequences. In addition to its high cost in terms of human lives and impact on millions of internally displaced persons and refugees in third countries, the war in Ukraine has affected the availability of food and fuel throughout the world.
Together with other unresolved armed conflicts, the war in Ukraine is seriously undermining cooperation and the global order based on international law. As a responsible State committed to the promotion of the peaceful settlement of disputes, Mexico would like to make the following proposal before the General Assembly to foster dialogue and peace in Ukraine.
The Security Council — it must be said — has been unable to fulfil the mandate conferred upon it by the Charter of the United Nations by having failed to prevent the war, take the measures needed to end the armed aggression and, to a greater degree, initiate any diplomatic process to seek a solution through dialogue and negotiations. It has also been unable to ensure the delivery of the all the humanitarian assistance required and, unfortunately, to openly support the work of the Secretary-General and other actors in managing access to the markets for Russian- and Ukrainian-produced grain and fertilizer.
Confronted by that paralysis, we had to resort to the General Assembly and convene its eleventh special emergency session, in which Mexico, together with France, proposed the appropriate framework for channelling humanitarian aid in the adoption of resolution ES-11/2, which has undoubtedly been useful but is clearly inadequate in the wake of the destruction and suffering that the war has left behind. For those reasons, as he is aware of our individual and collective responsibility, His Excellency President Lopez Obrador of Mexico proposes that a delegation or caucus of Heads of State and Government encourage and support the Secretary-General’s efforts to promote measures to build trust, which has been lost, between the Russian Federation and Ukraine so as to establish, as soon as possible, the conditions necessary for the parties to avail themselves of the mechanisms designed for the peaceful settlement of disputes, as set forth in the Charter. In other words, before the paralysis of the Security Council, we must provide, inter alia, a diplomatic channel to complement those already in place to communicate with the parties to the conflict, with a view to reducing tensions and harnessing crucial mediation.
This proposal has been shared in recent days with the Secretary-General, the parties concerned and the delegations of India and the Holy See, since President Lopez Obrador believes that His Excellency
Narendra Modi and His Holiness Pope Francis, among others, should participate, together with the Secretary- General, in any such delegation. We will continue with the necessary consultations, with the sole purpose of being able to contribute, as an impartial actor and in good faith, to generate the broadest possible support for the efforts and good offices of the Secretary-General and the caucus, whose formation we hope will proceed, with the support of United Nations Member States.
For nearly two years, as an elected member of the Security Council, Mexico has sought to address the structural causes of conflicts and promote preventive diplomacy as a central element in the maintenance of international peace and security. We have brought to the Council’s attention issues that had been neglected, such as poverty, corruption and inequality, as underlying factors of conflict, the goal of ensuring mental health as an integral part of humanitarian aid, concepts of masculinity to prevent radicalization and terrorism, the importance of respecting the collective security system established under the Charter and the need for coordination and cooperation in achieving peace among the principal organs of the United Nations.
The illicit flow of small arms and light weapons, as a result of their widespread availability, undermines regional and international security. That is why Mexico has urged for the need to take measures to stop their flow. That was also demonstrated by the adoption of Security Council resolution 2616 (2021), on respecting arms embargoes and ensuring that peace operations contribute to strengthening the capacities of national authorities to combat illicit arms trafficking and diversion. We have also advocated for transparency, efficiency, accountability and equitable participation in the Council’s work. In that regard, Mexico will continue to advocate a comprehensive reform of the Security Council, including more seats and with longer terms of office in the elected-member category, to make it more representative, transparent and efficient.
The paralysis of the Security Council is the result of the abuse of the poorly named “right of veto” by some of its permanent members. During this plenary meeting, two of them have even explicitly referred to the need to restrict its use to truly exceptional situations. In that regard, Mexico and France have continued to advocate that the permanent members refrain from resorting to the veto in situations of mass atrocities. We invite those States that have not yet done so to join that initiative, which is already supported by 106 States.
In the meantime, Mexico and 83 other States have promoted an accountability mechanism whereby, each time a veto is recorded in the Security Council, the General Assembly would meet without delay to discuss the issue and invite the author or authors of the veto to explain their position or positions. That proposal, which was adopted unanimously by resolution 76/262 and has already been used twice, points in the right direction. It is now up to us to decide whether we want to take the subsequent steps to prevent the system from continuing to be paralysed in the face of massive human suffering.
Nuclear weapons continue to represent the worst threat to the very survival of humankind. Mexico regrets the lack of political will, particularly on the part of the nuclear-weapon States, to reach agreements to achieve that goal, something that was confirmed at the recent Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which did not achieve any results, even though the risks of nuclear proliferation are becoming more real and obvious every day. My country agrees with the Secretary-General’s vision that a safer and more peaceful world must be based on international law, cooperation and solidarity — and not on the incessant accumulation and modernization of nuclear and conventional arsenals. It was precisely that vision that led the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean to establish the first nuclear-weapon-free zone in a densely populated area through the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which led to the conclusion and entry into force, in recent years, of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
Mexico reaffirms that the United Nations continues to be a unique tool of the international community for the peaceful resolution of disputes and the achievement of the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Our country will continue to promote multilateralism, international solidarity and cooperation as the best way to face global challenges.
We cannot close the door to political dialogue and diplomatic negotiation. Current international tensions will not be resolved by force. We must secure political understandings and confidence-building mechanisms. Indeed, restoring trust is one of our greatest challenges. Mexico calls on all Member States to work together to achieve the peace we all yearn for, to work as one in post-pandemic recovery with a sustainable and resilient approach that fully considers the needs and priorities of all countries and which puts people at the centre of our actions."
Moldova,MDA,Europe,"  4,052,000 ",5851,4.453999996,5.7,71.808,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Digestive Disease,593,14.63,"  4,052,000 ",100.00,8.29,"I stand before the General Assembly today proudly representing the Republic of Moldova, a future member of the European Union (EU). I am grateful for the unanimous support that we received from the 27 EU member States. I thank them for their recognition and vote of trust in our love for freedom, our dynamic democracy and our commitment to the rule of law.
A successful peace project, the European Union — through cooperation and integration — was forged to stop the cycle of wars that tormented our continent for centuries. This is another watershed moment in our history, and the EU has to do it again. By applying to join the European Union, we want the world to know that we are choosing democracy over autocracy, liberty over oppression, peace over war and prosperity over poverty. The EU candidate status gives us hope, a clear sense of direction, a unifying goal, an anchor and a strong sense of belonging to the free world.
One year ago, none of us here would have imagined a major war in Europe. Russia’s unprovoked war against another sovereign State, Ukraine, has shaken the world to the core, put to the test the fundamental principles of the United Nations, shattered global security and triggered a European energy crisis, global food shortages and an economic downturn. Seven months of bombings have killed thousands of innocent people and pushed millions of Ukrainians to flee their homes.
This war is not just an attack on our neighbour and friend Ukraine. It is an attack on the rules-based international order. It is an attack on nuclear safety. It is an attack on food supplies to countries in the Middle East and Africa. It is an attack on this very institution where we find ourselves in today.
We firmly condemn the war against Ukraine, as well as the recently announced additional mobilization of troops by Russia. We firmly stand with Ukraine and support its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders.
I would like to express my utmost admiration to all Ukrainians for their courage, resilience and inner power to continue this fight for survival, justice and freedom.
It is our moral duty, as an international community, to continue supporting Ukraine. Ukraine is fighting today to keep all of us safe, to keep Europe safe. It needs our support. All of us in Europe must help Ukraine.
As I stand at this rostrum, I represent a country that wants peace. I represent the citizens of Moldova, who, irrespective of the language that we speak — Romanian, Ukrainian, Russian, Gagauz or Bulgarian — and regardless of our ethnicity or political preferences, whether we live on the right bank of the Dniester River or in the breakaway region of Transnistria, we all want peace.
We are a country of fewer than 3 million people, but we have sheltered more than half a million refugees fleeing the war. At the peak of the inflow, our population grew by 4 per cent. Some 80,000 refugees chose to stay among us. I take this opportunity to pay tribute from this high rostrum to all Moldovan families who showed unprecedented solidarity with refugees by opening their homes and hearts to those in need. I am proud of my people.
I am also grateful to our international partners, including the United Nations, that have provided assistance in managing the humanitarian crisis. I also thank the Secretary-General and other high-level officials who visited our country in our hour of need in order to show support and solidarity. My deep gratitude goes to France, Germany, Romania and other partners for setting up the Moldova Support Platform, which stands by our country in these difficult times.
Moldova knows what it is to be a country divided by conflict. In 1992, we faced a brief but tragic war in the Transnistrian region of our country. Three decades later, we are still trying to overcome the consequences of that conflict and reintegrate our country. The only way to achieve that is through peaceful dialogue and respect for our sovereignty and territorial integrity.
As Russia has launched its war against Ukraine, we have worked harder than ever to maintain peace on both banks of the Dniester River. We have done our best to ensure that all citizens of Moldova, including those residing in the breakaway region, continue to enjoy peace. The illegal presence of the Russian military troops in the Transnistrian region infringes upon our neutrality and increases the security risks for our country.
We call for the complete and unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops. We call for the destruction of ammunition from the Cobasna stockpiles, which pose a security and environmental threat to the region as a whole.
As we strive to maintain peace, our economy and society are bearing the brunt of Russia’s war against Ukraine. Our resources are strained, investments have slowed down, trade and transport routes have been disrupted and inflation is nearing 35 per cent. In addition, we are facing a wide spectrum of hybrid threats, from disinformation and propaganda to cyberattacks and energy pressures.
The abnormally high prices for natural gas and Russia’s attempts to weaponize gas and oil supplies to Europe have triggered an unprecedented energy crisis. We are one of the most vulnerable countries in the face of this crisis. But that only makes us more determined to diversify our energy sources and decrease dependence on fossil fuels. We plan to increase the share of renewable electricity supplies from 3 to 30 per cent in the next three years. That will make our country stronger and our environment healthier and safer.
We all know that the only way to save the planet is through joint global action against climate change. The same goes for the fight against corruption. Corruption weakens States and erodes democracies. We should take it more seriously than we have ever done. We need clear international mechanisms to stop the flow of dirty money. We need better instruments for asset recovery and restitution. We need better information exchanges between law-enforcement and anti-fraud authorities in other countries. And we need to set up international sanctions regimes against corruption. Despite all the challenges, Moldova is pressing ahead with its reform agenda. We are building a stronger and more democratic State. Last year, Moldova moved up 49 positions in the press freedom index, ranking fortieth in the world. Justice reform and the fight against corruption are at the core of our transformation.
We are working hard to become a better place for investors to create jobs, boost the economy and bring greater prosperity to our people. We are investing in connectivity with Europe, and we are trying to bring our country closer to European standards. We are building roads and bridges, hospitals and a more modern education system. We are building stronger institutions that will benefit the citizens of Moldova. We are focused, persistent and relentless. We are determined to bring Moldova into the EU so that every Moldovan can have better living standards and more economic opportunities at home. That is the only way for Moldova to grow as a consolidated democracy in our part of the world during these difficult times.
As I come before the Assembly from a region weakened by war, an energy crisis, drought and rampant inflation, my message is this. In the face of human- made suffering and economic adversity, the countries of the world must stand together once again. We must do so to reaffirm the value of peace and the inviolability of human life, to defend democracy and freedom and to uphold the right of every country to decide its own fate.

Mongolia,MNG,Asia,"  3,170,000 ",11105,6.959000111,5.5,69.689,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Digestive Disease,577,18.20,"  3,109,770 ",98.10,9.15,"I wish to convey my heartfelt congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi on his unanimous election as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy- seventh session and wish him every success in his work.
We have no doubt that the seventy-seventh session will play an important role in boosting the social and economic recovery of the countries of the world in the post-pandemic era, implementing the Sustainable Development Goals, combating climate change and desertification and determining ways to resolve international crises and conflicts through dialogue and peaceful means.
Last year we celebrated the sixtieth anniversary of Mongolia’s full-fledged membership in the United Nations. This year we are observing the thirtieth anniversary of Mongolia’s declaration of its territory as a nuclear-weapon-free zone and the twentieth anniversary of Mongolia’s participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations.
On behalf of my country and my people, it is therefore a great privilege for me to state from this rostrum that, during those six decades, Mongolia has been a responsible member of the United Nations, actively participating and cooperating in multilateral efforts within the international community, making tangible contributions to global peace and security and promoting the well-being and development of humankind.
The whole world is going through difficult ordeals and challenges, such as poverty, inequality, climate change, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and pandemic-related hurdles with regard to customs, transport and logistics, price increases and inflation, as well as geostrategic and geopolitical tensions.
According to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, even in these difficult times, when the countries of the world were closing their borders and imposing restrictions and quarantines in order to protect the lives and health of their citizens from the COVID-19 pandemic, often triggering economic crises, global military expenditures continued to grow in 2021, reaching an all-time high of $2.1 trillion.
If that huge budget and funds spent on the military and armaments had been dedicated to the least developed and developing countries, how many millions of children’s futures would have been brighter, how many millions would have been lifted out of poverty, how many millions would have been freed from hunger and disease, how many millions would have had food and opportunities for education and employment and places to live? It is time for all of us to ponder and reflect upon what progress could have been achieved if that colossal sum of money had been spent on the pressing issues of combating global warming and climate change.
It is truly regrettable that the situation in the world is deteriorating and that mistrust and misunderstanding are deepening even though humankind has suffered enough in the twentieth century due to the scourge of the two World Wars, the Cold War divide, interreligious conflicts and terrorism, among other things. In today’s complex reality, we should therefore always strive to learn from the mistakes of the past, build mutual trust, understanding and respect and make every effort to resolve every misunderstanding, conflict or war by peaceful means and dialogue.
Eight centuries ago, our ancestor — the Great Genghis Khan — united all Mongolian dwellers, founded the great Mongolian State under the power of the eternal blue sky, put an end to the centuries-long wars and conflicts, brought peace to the West and East under the rule of justice and established the Pax Mongolica in the vast terrain of Eurasia.
Scholars and researchers around the world view the establishment of the Pax Mongolica as an important contribution of Mongols to world history and the advancement of humankind and emphasize that the Pax Mongolica played an important role in the development of free trade between countries, laid the foundation for diplomacy and exchange of envoys, as well as proclaimed the ideas of religious freedom and the rule of law without imposing one’s culture and religion on others.
The General Assembly resolution entitled “Eight hundred years of Mongolian statehood”, adopted in 2005, touted the contribution of Mongols to the history of humankind and recognized that “nomadic civilization influenced, inter alia, societies across Asia and Europe and, in turn, absorbed influences from both East and West in a true interchange of human values” (resolution 60/16, fifth preambular paragraph).
It further recognized “the important role played by a strong and persistent nomadic culture in the development of extensive trade networks and the creation of large administrative, cultural, religious and commercial centres” {ibid., sixth preambular paragraph).
Finally, it acknowledged the “ever-increasing significance and relevance of a culture of living in harmony with nature, which is inherent in nomadic civilization, in today’s world” {ibid., seventh preambular paragraph).
That indicates that the Pax Mongolica contained progressive ideas that would form the basis of the collective efforts of the international community to maintain peace and stability in the modern world. Therefore, we, the descendants of the founders of the Pax Mongolica, call on the international community to understand each other, cooperate and manage every conflict through peaceful dialogue so that our blue planet can be at peace and a “Pax Globalica” can be established. We further call on people of the world to combine efforts to achieve that noble goal.
Mongolia has consistently pursued a peace-loving, open, multipolar and independent foreign policy. During his official visit to Mongolia in August, Secretary- General Antonio Guterres used the phrase “a symbol of peace in a troubled world” — a clear recognition of that policy by the international community. Mongolia has actively participated in the promotion of international peace and security and in peacekeeping efforts and has put forward several proposals and initiatives. One notable example is the declaration of its territory as a nuclear-weapon-free zone.
In his statement at the opening of the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, held in August, the Secretary-General warned that humankind is just “one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation”. In that connection, I urge not only States Parties to the treaty but all States Members of the United Nations to exert political will and courage to build a world free of nuclear weapons and to unite and work together wholeheartedly and faithfully for the sake of our Mother Earth, peace and future generations.
Mongolia believes that nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation, the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones are the best and most effective means of building a world free of nuclear weapons. We therefore consider that international recognition of Mongolia’s nuclear- weapon-free status is our tangible contribution and effort to this cause.
This year marks the twentieth anniversary of Mongolia’s participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations. During that period, more than 20,000 Mongolian military personnel served in United Nations and other international peacekeeping operations in hotspots around the world.
Mongolia sent its first female officer to a United Nations peacekeeping operation in 2006, and now we are ranked among the top 20 of 120 countries in number of female peacekeepers contributed to United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Mongolia is firmly committed to the implementation of the resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security, and to the call by the United Nations Department of Peace Operations to increase the number of women serving in the United Nations peacekeeping operations to 15 per cent by 2027. Within the framework of that objective, at my country’s initiative, we hosted an international conference on strengthening the role of women in peacekeeping, in June. The conference, which brought together female peacekeepers from more than 30 countries and representatives of international organizations, became a notable event for sharing
and exchanging knowledge, experience and lessons learned. We also put forward an initiative to host that conference every five years, and it is our hope that the relevant United Nations entities and troop-contributing countries will support that proposal.
At the same time, it is my pleasure to underscore that the United Nations and its leadership have greatly appreciated the genuine contributions of peace-loving Mongolia to United Nations peacekeeping operations and the sacred cause of strengthening international peace and security and have given full support to our proposals and initiatives.
Mongolia has consistently proposed the establishment of a dialogue mechanism with a view to contributing to peace and security in North-East Asia and to efforts of the international community to denuclearize the Korean peninsula. In that context, in 2013, Mongolia launched the initiative to organize the international conference “Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian Security”. In June, we organized the seventh international conference of the “Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian Security” and discussed a broad range of issues, including regional security, the power grid, green development, opportunities for humanitarian cooperation and the post-pandemic economic recovery. The results of the conference demonstrate that the significance of the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue initiative has grown, and it is transforming into an open and inclusive mechanism gathering Government officials and academia from countries in the subregion and beyond, as well as representatives of international organizations.
In the face of frequent natural disasters and communicable diseases, the creation of an integrated regional infrastructure for disaster risk reduction and humanitarian assistance is becoming one of the most pressing security issues in North-East Asia.
With that in mind, in 2018 Mongolia put forward an initiative to establish an integrated platform for disaster risk reduction for the North-East Asia region, and now we present a proposal to establish a regional humanitarian hub or warehouse based on the Ulaanbaatar International Airport-affiliated facilities. I am confident that those initiatives will be supported and assisted by other countries of the region, as well as by the United Nations system and specialized organizations.
Broad-scale economic restrictions and sanctions caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical conflicts have hit national economies hard. The global market prices for food, fuel, agricultural products, energy and raw materials have increased sharply like never before, causing fluctuation in the global economy and financial markets and creating major risks.
With the immediate support of the United Nations and its system organizations, as well as that of development partners, for Mongolia’s efforts to fight COVID-19, as of today 70 per cent of the population is fully vaccinated, domestic restrictions have been removed and borders have been opened.
Although we are going through an uneasy period, the Government of Mongolia is implementing the new recovery policy developed in harmony with the Sustainable Development Goals. The policy focuses on improving road, railway and border infrastructure; increasing energy sources; boosting industrialization, as well as urban and rural development; and enhancing public-private partnership and productivity.
Furthermore, despite tough times of the pandemic and new normal, Mongolia is making efforts to accelerate the digital transition and adopted a package of new laws on digital development. We introduced the e-Mongolia platform in order to streamline public-service delivery to citizens and entities, to reduce corruption and bureaucracy, to increase information security and to promote good governance. Moreover, we are working to expand and develop our multilateral cooperation in those fields at regional and international levels.
Mongolia fully supports the major initiatives put forward in the Secretary-General’s Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) and is sparing no effort to implement them alongside the Sustainable Development Goals, the national Vision-2050 long-term development policy and the New Recovery Policy.
We must not forget that the serious challenges we are facing, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, desertification, land degradation, shortages of water resources and droughts, are still awaiting solutions.
Mongolia is one of the countries most affected by climate change. Therefore, with a view to combating climate change, desertification and dust storms and in order to increase forest and water resources, Mongolia launched the Billion Trees national movement in order to plant, grow and protect billions of trees. The Mongolian people, its Government and our development partners
welcomed that initiative, and now the Billion Trees national movement is being successfully implemented throughout the country. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that the Secretary-General has personally joined and supports the movement.
In addition, Mongolia reiterates its commitment to actively cooperate and make a real contribution to reducing the negative impact of climate change and protecting the environment at regional and international levels. In that context, it is my pleasure to inform the Assembly that Mongolia will be hosting the seventeenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, in 2026.
Another issue that should be brought to the attention of the General Assembly is the scarcity of pastures, as the space for nomadic livestock is shrinking day by day, and nomadic civilization is facing the danger of extinction.
We Mongolians are a nomadic and pastoralist people. The lives of more than 200 million people who raise livestock and live in harmony with nature like we do are at risk now due to climate change, land degradation, desertification, drought and extreme winter events. In order to protect their interests, improve pasture management and use, preserve the ecosystem balance and provide global food security and supply, Mongolia initiated a General Assembly resolution proclaiming the year 2026 as International Year of Rangelands and Pastoralists (resolution 76/253), which was adopted on 15 March 2022.
We launched the Billion Trees national movement along with the national programmes Food Supply and Security and Healthy Mongolia in order to help attain the Sustainable Development Goals and create a healthy environment in which people can live a healthy life consuming healthy food. We highly appreciate the support and cooperation that the countries of the region and international organizations extended to those efforts.
Nowadays, with the drastic change in the international order and norms established after the Second World War, the importance of multilateralism and the role of the international community are evermore increasing. For that reason, we are of the view that it is important that every Member State take an active part in the process of United Nations reforms and constructively contribute to strengthening the position and role of the Organization. Mongolia is of the view that the key to reforming the United Nations is the reform of the Security Council, which bears the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. Since 2009, Mongolia has been regularly participating in the intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform, expressing its principled position.
Developments in recent years have shown that the General Assembly is the most important platform for discussing global peace, security, human rights and development issues. We therefore deem that strengthening the role of the General Assembly is important to ensure the balance of power among countries and highlight the voices of small and developing countries more vividly.
Lastly, I wish to call on Member States to support the United Nations quintet of change, outlined in the Secretary-General’s report Our Common Agenda, for a more effective United Nations 2.0. Let us collectively make efforts to ensure global peace, security, development and prosperity.
May the eternal blue sky bless us, humankind, forever."

The world staggers from one crisis to the next, from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic to yet another war, and today we are all concerned.
Montenegro’s position on the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine is that we stand with the people of Ukraine and strongly oppose the aggression, which is an attack on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that country. War is not the solution. Aggression is not the solution. Bombs are not the solution.
We come from a part of the world that knows well the cost of humanitarian and refugee crises stemming from ethnic conflict and the uselessness of raising armies against one another. That is not the solution. In the twenty-first century, humankind should be smarter than that. We should not use war to resolve political problems. That is not a solution.
We should sit together and engage in dialogue to consider the different political options. States must find a way to engage in dialogue. I know that that is not easy, but war is not the solution.
We will continue to support Ukraine. We will do so permanently. Our agenda is to follow European Union (EU) foreign policy to the letter, including sanctions against the Russia Federation. It is not a question of economics; it is a question of principles and standards. Today we have an aggression against Ukraine; tomorrow some other State could be attacked.
We need to find other solutions. War has created a lot of problems. In Montenegro, we have around 10,000 Ukrainian refugees. For many of the countries represented in this Hall, that is not a huge number, but for Montenegro, a small country, it is almost to 2 per cent of the population. As Montenegro’s Prime Minister, I am very proud to say that everyone in Montenegro feels very comfortable and very safe. We will continue to open the door for people in trouble.
We will not say that they are not welcome. They are welcome. And with our relatively small capacity, we will support everything that upholds democratic standards and solidarity with our fellow human beings.
War produces a great many problems. At this very moment, however, we are facing another crisis — an energy crisis — which may lead us to experience a very problematic winter in Europe. We should understand one simple thing: today’s energy crisis will become tomorrow’s economic crisis, which will then, in turn, become a security crisis the day after tomorrow. If we do not find a solution together with EU countries, we will be facing some very big problems.
Why are we facing an energy crisis? It is not only because of war. There are two factors that are driving the world’s current energy crisis, especially in Europe. The first factor is the war in Ukraine, which is making a mess of the energy markets, triggering an increase in the price of every kind of energy, including electricity. The second factor is climate change. Today in Europe, we have rivers that are at their lowest levels. We have lakes that are also at their lowest levels. And it is at the United Nations that we must engage in solving this problem for the future. We are therefore experiencing an energy crisis, but it is not just because of the war. War is a key factor, but it is a secondary factor. The main factor is climate change. We need to protect the environment for future generations.
I want to talk about the environment because I come from a State that, in its Constitution, is dedicated to being an ecological State. We are the only State in the world whose Constitution declares it to be an ecological State, and I am more than sure that constitutions in future will be written with ecological provisions designed to protect the environment. We want to build our country as a green destination. I am very proud to say that we can still drink water from rivers in the north of my country.
It is crucial that we protect nature, undertake green projects, find solutions to the problem of pollution and everything else that destroys nature. I agree with those who say that we need to take greater care. This is not a question for one country alone. We need to act with unity and solidarity in this, or we will worsen the problem. Green projects and the protection of the environment are items high on Montenegro’s agenda. We hope that together with other countries we will find a productive and sustainable solution for the future.
Another important issue for us is transitional justice, which has been with us in the Western Balkans for many years. Members know that we had a major conflict in the past, and that, since the dissolution of Yugoslavia, there has been a great deal of fighting over ethnic and religious problems. Today we are trying to build a modern European society, but we cannot do that if we are still dealing with transitional justice.
There are two types of peace: positive peace and negative peace. Negative peace is when there is absence of conflict, but institutions are weak, politicized, unprofessional and controlled by corrupt leaders. That is negative peace.
We want to see more positive peace in the region. Positive peace stems from independent institutions, an independent judiciary and efforts to fight against organized crime and corruption, especially corrupt leaders who promote nationalism and conflict in the region because they want to maintain the regional status quo and foreclose the possibility of new leaders coming to power to make changes in the country or in the region.
Positive peace is something what we want to fight for. It is the way that we can end the period of transitional justice. It is how we can look at and deal with what happened in the past. Without pursuing that, we will not have the truth, and without truth we will not have reconciliation.
Our country is in this Hall to promote reconciliation. Our country is in this Hall to shake hands with representatives of every country in the world that seeks to be grounded in universal principles. The people of Montenegro want justice. I believe that the people of many countries represented in this Hall want to see more justice globally and more justice locally.
We are very proud of our very inclusive multicultural society. It is true that our country has had problems, but we try to solve them in the right way. Everyone is more than welcome in Montenegro. We need to move forward by promoting, just as members of the Human Rights Council do, human rights everywhere, inclusive open societies, for the sake of every nation, ethnicity, religion, and individual.
We are proud of our diversity. We promote diversity. Diversity is good for every society. It is good to see the cosmopolitan spirit in New York these days. We want to have that kind of society.
We want to promote more media freedom. We want to condemn people who are against media freedom. In our country, we are still investigating the killing of some well-known journalists that took place 20 years ago.
We are not proud of that. We want to have institutions that can fix the problem and punish people who attack the media.
Media freedom is an important part of democracy. In our country we should do more about that. We should promote freedom of media and every kind of every kind of freedom.
I am very proud of the Government of Montenegro’s in fighting organized crime and promoting justice in this most recent period. Why do I mention this now? I do so because it is not only Montenegro’s problem.
I refer in this regard to high-level corruption, namely, cigarette smuggling and cocaine smuggling. Some 20 per cent of all cigarettes smuggled in EU countries go through Montenegro. We are the country which, in the last six months, seized 149,000 cartons of cigarettes, worth more than $120 million on the market. That is the biggest action against cigarette smuggling in all of Europe. Last year we undertook a similar action against cocaine smuggling. That cocaine was not sold in Montenegro because Montenegro has 600,000 people; it is cocaine for sale in Western Europe. These results show very clearly the Government’s orientation as well as that of the State and the people of Montenegro: we no longer wish to have organized crime or corruption in our country.
We are ready to commit to that, and we invite the General Assembly and the rest of the United Nations, as well as other partners, to support us, because it is a transnational problem. It is not the problem of only one country.
We will continue these efforts with our international partners and with States that provide us with a lot of information. But it is important to understand that behind nationalism in the region hides corruption. Again, behind nationalism in the Western Balkans lies corruption. Fighting against corruption will fight nationalism. The less corruption there is, the less nationalism there will be; the less corruption there is, the less tension there will be. With less corruption, we can focus on the economy and on progress.
With current levels of corruption, our attention will always be focused on the past. We cannot change the past. The only thing we can change is the future. Our common strategy should be to change the future in the right way.
With regard to Montenegro’s foreign policy, I would like to underline two very important points. We are full members of NATO. We made a very good decision in 2017 to join NATO. Now, in a period of crisis, when we see that such countries as Sweden and Finland are joining NATO, everybody in Montenegro understands why our joining was so important.
Another one of our goals — and this is bigger than NATO membership — is to join the EU. We want to be part of the big European family. For small countries like Montenegro, it is very important to be in the democratic countries club. We want to be the next member of the EU. We are dedicated to doing everything we must do to find the solution to joining the EU as soon as possible.
The Western Balkans should not be the black hole of Europe. The Western Balkans can make great contributions to Europe and to the world, with its culture, diversity, people — with everything they have to offer
And it is very important to understand that we are not alone. I am more than sure that we are not alone, but we need first to finish with our internal Montenegrin issues, and we are really ready to do that.
It is very important for us to have regional cooperation and for us to support regional initiatives. All regional initiatives that bring greater focus on the economy and on progress are welcome in our country. We want to see people who had problems with each other in the past to sit together and discuss these projects.
We are really proud to be the positive case in the region. We are the country that builds bridges between other countries. We continue to be ready to play that role in the coming period.
We want to see how Serbia and Kosovo find common agreement. We want to see how our neighbour Bosnia and Herzegovina finds internal agreement with itself. We want to see all of its six States of the Balkans form a productive Balkans region. Every inclusive initiative is more than welcome for our country. We cannot feel comfortable if we are successful and our neighbours are not. We want to be successful together. We want to see every single country — not just in the region, but in the world — succeed. This is the politics of a small country called Montenegro.
We want to promote peace. Our wish is to promote peace. Our wish is to promote stability and progress. I think that the opportunity afforded us in these five or six days in New York is the future. We understand that deglobalization — a concept that got its start a few years ago — is not sustainable. Every problem of every country can very easily be the problem of another country.
That is why we should talk, why we should find solutions together, why we need to promote more unity everywhere.
In our country, the world will always find a partner for good initiatives. For everything that brings peace, progress and stability, we are ready to participate. We will be found in the General Assembly with every country in the world that wishes to promote the same values.
We need to promote more ethics in global politics and less populism. We need to promote more concrete action and less rhetoric. We need to promote more justice and less support for authoritarian regimes around the globe.
Our duty is to give our best so that democracy may survive. Democracy should be more functional, and we should stick together. A globalized world is like a village.
Nobody can say that this is not important for me personally. We are in this Hall to discuss and understand that everyone is important. The size of the population of a country or the territory of a country is irrelevant. Everyone is important. Every voice is important. We need to advocate democracy. We need to advocate universal values. This is how we can make the world a better place for all of us.
I am grateful for this opportunity to address the General Assembly, and on behalf of the people of Montenegro, I wish all members the greatest success in each of their countries."
Morocco,MAR,Africa,"  36,029,000 ",7613,9.331999779,4.9,76.453,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,2617,7.26,"  36,029,000 ",100.00,6.32,"On behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco, it is my pleasure to congratulate the President on his election to preside
over the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session. I wish him every success in his tasks. We also commend the distinctive work done by his predecessor, Mr. Abdulla Shahid, and we highly appreciate the outcome of his presidency.
We reiterate our support for the efforts of the Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, to reform our Organization. We express to him our support and backing for his initiatives and proposals contained in his report entitled Our Common Agenda (A/75/982).
The seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly is taking place at a time when our world is witnessing multidimensional crises with global intertwined repercussions. Three years after the onset of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, our world faces a series of deep challenges and successive crises.
What prevents us from managing those crises in an efficient and effective manner is not the fact that we are not aware of their manifestations and interactions, but rather the absence of genuine political will. The multilateral system is currently going through a systemic crisis that manifests itself at three interrelated levels.
The first level relates to the crisis in values, in which the principle of cooperation and solidarity, on which the United Nations was founded, is being undermined due to the prioritization of narrow national interests over universal human values.
The second level is related to the divisions within international institutions, which have become an arena for competition in a way that negatively affects international multilateral action.
The third level relates to the fragmentation of multilateral work in the context of narrow, circumstantial alliances, which are not commensurate with the current complex crises.
The current international situation requires courage and objectivity to answer the following questions. Do we want our Organization to be capable of leading strategic changes and facing the major challenges of our time, or do we want it to be limited to only crisis management? Does our Organization still have the ability to reach an international consensus and find innovative solutions to deal with the current and future challenges of the world?
We would like to say that those who believe that their own capabilities are sufficient alone to contain such challenges are not being realistic. Multilateral work has never been a luxury, and the comprehensive crises that we are experiencing today confirm that and prove that the security and well-being of some depend on the stability and prosperity of others.
The Kingdom of Morocco reiterates its conviction that multilateral action should be based primarily on collective interaction, consensual and renewed approaches, as emphasized by His Majesty King Mohammed VI in his address before the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session, when he said:
“Morocco reaffirms its commitment to support the emergence of a new multilateral system built on international legality, justice and equity and cooperation in social and economic relations, and based on an efficient and dynamic United Nations system.” (A/59/PV4. p.23)
The African continent is the most affected by the repercussions of the difficult economic situation as a result of the global geopolitical crisis, as it bears the brunt of the increase in food and energy prices, which undermines the continent’s gains in the area of sustainable development.
Despite that, Africa has all the components to turn challenges into opportunities and emerge from this crisis stronger. The African continent has significant human and natural resources in addition to the gains and future benefits that it can achieve by implementing the African Continental Free Trade Area. That was affirmed by His Majesty the King in his address at the 28th Ordinary Summit of the African Union when he said:
“We, the peoples of Africa, have the means and the genius, and, together, we can fulfil the aspirations of our peoples.”
In that context, the Kingdom of Morocco calls for promoting international cooperation to serve the interests of African countries by reducing the debt burden and launching integrated development initiatives that will enhance their resilience and resist the shocks of current and future economic crises. The repeated visits of His Majesty King Mohammed VI to several African countries attest to that conviction. His Majesty has launched several cooperation and partnership projects to promote human development,
guarantee food security and bolster economic growth in order to achieve African integration. Under the auspices of His Majesty, the Kingdom of Morocco hosted the fourteenth United States-Africa Business Summit to encourage investment in priority sectors in African countries.
Several countries continue to suffer from the repercussions of COVID-19. The challenge lies in providing a consistent and adequate supply of vaccines and distributing them equitably among all the countries of the world. As part of his commitment to the African affiliation, His Majesty launched a new factory to manufacture COVID-19 and other vaccines, a structural project that will promote the achievement of vaccine sovereignty in the Kingdom of Morocco and throughout the African continent, in line with achieving his Majesty’s vision.
The pandemic has demonstrated that good health and prosperity are not only a main goal of sustainable development but also fundamental conditions and pillars of sustainable development. The Moroccan Government, upon instructions from His Majesty, is implementing and expanding health coverage, benefiting 70 per cent of our people. We hope to cover 100 per cent of the population by the end of the year.
Climate change requires immediate and urgent solutions. Beyond well-intentioned statements, we need to contain this crisis, which is jeopardizing development in many parts of the world and could lead to famine, homelessness and environmental displacement. In that context and in line with His Majesty’s vision, the Kingdom of Morocco has warned of the consequences of the climate crisis on the African continent, which has suffered its greatest impact. It is therefore incumbent upon the developed countries to garner the needed technological and financial resources to support the African States in addressing the consequences of that global challenge.
The Kingdom has decided to increase its nationally determined contribution and reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions by 45.5 per cent by 2030, in the context of Morocco’s integrated strategy to achieve low- carbon development by 2050. The strategy is aimed at creating a green economy in line with the principles of sustainability, the pillars on which we have built the new development model within the Kingdom. That ambition underpins the Kingdom of Morocco’s intention to uphold the commitments it undertook at the 2016 African Summit in Marrakech, which was held on the sidelines of the twenty-second Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, under the presidency of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, especially with regard to developing capacities in the agricultural sector, adapting to climate change and increasing the use of sustainable energy.
Global tensions will continue to adversely impact the efforts being deployed to achieve food security unless countries develop their domestic capacities to take the new reality into account. In that context, Morocco has been investing in the agricultural sector so that it can adapt to climate change. We have been strengthening South-South cooperation with the African continent, on which nearly half of the world’s unused arable land is located. At the national level, Morocco is implementing the Generation Green 2020-2030 plan under the directives of His Majesty in order achieve food security.
The global security crises are directly affecting human migration throughout the world. In line with His Majesty’s vision, the Kingdom of Morocco is committed to the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, which was signed in Marrakech in December 2018. In that regard, the Kingdom will continue to demonstrate its solidarity in implementing its national strategy for migration and asylum, which was launched by His Majesty in 2013. In the same vein, Morocco continues to combat human trafficking networks, which represent a serious threat to the sovereignty and stability of States and the security and safety of individuals.
Peacekeeping is one of the most important achievements of the Organization, and we must therefore pool our efforts and capabilities to develop it and guarantee peacekeepers’ safety. In demonstrating his permanent commitment to peacekeeping on the occasion of the sixty-sixth anniversary of the founding of the Royal Moroccan Armed Forces, His Majesty gave instructions to create a Moroccan multidisciplinary peacekeeping centre to provide training and support national and foreign capacities, especially on the African continent, in partnership with the United Nations and several friendly countries, in order to promote the principles of international peace and security.
Gender equality and the promotion of the rights of women and their full participation in decision-making are preconditions to overcoming current and future global challenges. In line with that and with His Majesty’s vision, Morocco is working to promote gender equality as the foundation for a fair and democratic society. His Majesty has given new momentum to gender equality through the full implementation of the provisions of the Moroccan Family Code. The Kingdom has also launched the first national plan of action for women, peace and security, as an integrated political framework for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), based on our belief in the importance of the full participation of women in preventing and settling conflicts.
The Kingdom of Morocco reiterates its commitment to finding a definitive political solution to the contrived regional conflict over the Moroccan Sahara, which should be based on the Moroccan autonomy initiative as the only solution to this conflict, while respecting the territorial integrity and the national sovereignty of the Kingdom. Since we introduced that serious and realistic initiative in 2007, it has been supported by the Security Council and more than 90 States.
In the southern regions, the Kingdom is implementing a new development model launched by His Majesty in 2015. All those living in the region are participating fully in every stage of its implementation through their democratically elected representatives in the local councils of the Moroccan Sahara.
The active participation of the inhabitants of the Moroccan Sahara in its political, social and economic aspects of life attests to their attachment to the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Morocco and the Moroccan Sahara. In adhering to the statement made by His Majesty King Mohammed VI on the forty-sixth anniversary of the Green March, the Kingdom of Morocco reaffirms its full support for the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy for Western Sahara to relaunch a series of round tables, in the same format and with the same participants, to reach a realistic and lasting political solution based on consensus and in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions, especially, most recently, resolution 2602 (2021). The serious and well-intentioned participation of Algeria in those round tables and the acknowledgement of its responsibility in creating and pursuing the contrived conflict will be the first prerequisite to reaching a final political settlement of the issue.
The Kingdom of Morocco expresses once again its deep concern about the catastrophic humanitarian situation and the absence of the rule of law in the Tindouf camps. In blatant violation of international humanitarian law, Algeria has ceded its responsibilities over that part of its territory to armed separatist militias that have documented links to dangerous terrorist networks in the Sahel region. We again call on the international community to urge Algeria to respond to the calls made by the Security Council since 2011 and allow the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to organize a census and register the inhabitants of the Tindouf camps.
In a letter that he sent on 20 December 2020 to His Excellency Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, President of the State of Palestine, His Majesty King Mohammed VI reiterated the steadfast position of Morocco in support of the Palestinian question, called for the implementation of two-State solution, for which there is international consensus, and reiterated Morocco’s commitment to the negotiations between the Palestinian and Israeli parties as the only way to reach a final, lasting and comprehensive solution to the conflict.
In his capacity as Chair of the Jerusalem Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, His Majesty reaffirmed that Morocco would spare no effort to preserve the historical identity of Jerusalem as a locus of coexistence and peace, continue to safeguard its special status, uphold respect for freedom of religion for the followers of the three monotheistic religions and defend the sanctity of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Based on our commitment to improving the living conditions of the Palestinians, His Majesty led mediation efforts that culminated in the agreement to maintain the Allenby Bridge, also known as the King Hussein Bridge, linking the West Bank and Jordan, continuously open. That will have a positive impact on the daily lives of Palestinians and facilitate the movement of people and goods.
Given its shared destiny with the State of Libya and in order to build on the positive momentum created by the Skhirat Agreement and Bouznika talks, the Kingdom of Morocco will pursue efforts to reach a peaceful settlement to the conflict in that brotherly country, in line with His Majesty’s vision. We are committed to finding a Libyan-led solution to the crisis, without any foreign interference or agenda.
The Kingdom of Morocco welcomes the appointment of Mr. Abdullah Bathily as Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Libya and Head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya, and reaffirms its full commitment to working with him and effectively contributing to efforts enabling the
Libyan stakeholders to reach the necessary agreements and organize parliamentary and presidential elections as the sole means to overcoming the current situation.
The scope of today’s challenges will require us to make one of two choices. Either we disregard the current crises facing the world, or we intensify our efforts to address them constructively and effectively. Our collective decisions will have a decisive impact on the lives of present and future generations.
The Kingdom of Morocco, in line with His Majesty’s vision and our actions since we joined the United Nations upon gaining independence, the Kingdom of Morocco will continue to uphold its commitments."

I would like to congratulate Your Excellency, Ambassador Csaba Korosi, upon your election as President of the General Assembly at its current session. I wish you great success in your mission. Let me also commend the work done by your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid. Under his presidency, we strengthened multilateral mechanisms in support of Member States to address global challenges such as coronavirus disease (COVID-19) .
To His Excellency Secretary-General Antonio Guterres go our words of appreciation for the wise manner in which he has led the work of our Organization.
Allow me also, on behalf of the Mozambican people, to thank all United Nations Member States for the support that contributed to the election of Mozambique as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the term 2023-2024. We acknowledge that election with a great sense of responsibility. Based on the motto of our candidacy, “International peace and security and sustainable development”, we will advocate for dialogue, the peaceful resolution of conflicts, the promotion of peace, the fight against terrorism and the role of multilateralism as an important tool to address the challenges facing the world.
The theme of the current session of the General Assembly reveals that the world is living through adverse and challenging times, characterized by a multiplicity of interlinked crises. Among those, we can highlight COVID-19, climate change and humanitarian crises, with their negative effects on the global economy.
The emergence of new outbreaks of internal tensions and inter-State conflicts, terrorism and international organized crime is negatively affecting the economic and social development of our countries. These are aggravating the food, energy and humanitarian crises and hampering the functioning of the supply chain in international markets. That is why Mozambique advocates for the need for constructive dialogue and concerted multilateral action, which are the only avenues for the preservation of peace and the continued promotion of the sustainable development of our countries.
For Mozambique, the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will guide us in the search for collective solutions to the problems of this era of change, which is also the theme of this session. In our own experience, the incorporation of the SDGs into the priorities and pillars of our governance programme has had significant positive results for household incomes and the fight against poverty; agricultural productivity and the development of the entire value chain; the supply of drinking water to the population, in particular in rural areas; the number of people with access to electricity; enrolment in primary, secondary, technical-professional and higher education schools; the rates of access and retention of girls in school, particularly in rural areas; and primary health care and vaccination programmes for children, as well as maternal and child health care.
Equally noteworthy is the expansion of services in the administration of justice, ensuring improved access to justice for citizens. We have also been promoting actions in the area of the blue economy, as well as in the protection and conservation of the environment and ecosystems. However, our experience also shows that we need to rethink the multilateral institutional financing model, which will allow more resources to be mobilized to complement internal efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
In the context of the prevention and combat of COVID-19, the Government of Mozambique has adopted a set of measures to contain the spread of the pandemic in order to ensure a balance between saving human lives and keeping the economy running. Among these measures, we have undertaken massive vaccination campaigns against the disease; 96.6 per cent of Mozambican citizens over 18 years of age have been vaccinated to date.
Each of our countries has lessons to draw from the fight against and prevention of COVID-19. I highlight the need for national health systems to be prepared to respond to health crises, which requires the provision of and universal access to medical equipment and the means necessary for prevention and treatment; funding to effectively respond to public health emergencies; the strengthening of education and the training of health professionals; the strengthening of bilateral and multilateral cooperation; and greater interaction and dialogue between public and private actors, to respond more effectively to crises with global impact.
Climate change has made Mozambique permanently vigilant. In recent times, our country has been cyclically and intensively affected by depressions, tropical cyclones, rains and strong winds, floods and droughts that have caused the loss of human life, the displacement of persons and extensive damage to infrastructure and socioeconomic activities. Between 2019 and 2022 alone, Mozambique was hit by Cyclones Idai, Kenneth, Guambe, Chalane, Ana and Gombe.
In order to respond to challenges related to the reduction and risk management of natural disasters, in 2021 Mozambique, in coordination with the countries of southern Africa and cooperation partners, established, in Nacala-Porto, in the north of the country, the Humanitarian and Emergency Operations Centre of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The Centre is aimed at providing SADC countries with tools and institutions capable of responding to and mitigating the impacts of climate change and other emergencies requiring rapid, coordinated and timely intervention in any member State.
Mozambique is committed to continuing to strengthen climate security, including through advocacy and the dissemination of good environmental protection practices, management and risk reduction of natural disasters. These actions reinforce the role that His Excellency Mr. Filipe Jacinto Nyusi, President of the Republic of Mozambique, has been playing in his capacity as the African Union Champion for Disaster Risk Management in Africa. In that vein, we call on the international community to join in our efforts so that we can continue to build resilience and adaptation capacity to address the effects of climate change, in line with the commitments made in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030.
With regard to the consolidation of national peace and reconciliation, Mozambique has made remarkable progress in the process of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) of former Resistencia Nacional Mogambicana (RENAMO) guerrillas. To date, 4,002 former RENAMO guerrillas, out of a total of 5,221, have been covered by this process. We foresee the conclusion of the DDR process by the end of this year, which will be an important milestone in the implementation of the Accord for National Peace and Reconciliation signed on 6 August 2019 between the Government of Mozambique and RENAMO. With the completion of this stage, we will focus on long-term reintegration and more effective reconciliation, which are crucial to ensuring the sustainability of the peace process and the consolidation of national unity. The remarkable progress we are making in DDR is due to the valuable assistance and support of the United Nations and the Contact Group.
In order to prevent terrorist activity in some districts of Cabo Delgado province, the Government has adopted a comprehensive approach that includes strengthening the operational capacity of the Defence and Security Forces, stabilizing security and creating conditions that will enable recovery, reconstruction and socioeconomic development, so that we can reduce the vulnerability of communities to violent extremism. Thanks to the actions undertaken by Mozambique, combined with the support and assistance of multilateral and bilateral cooperation partners, including SADC, the European Union and Rwanda, we have made progress in combating terrorism.
Mozambique’s approach is a pioneering one in terms of concerted regional action to address the global threat of terrorism. The ongoing actions on the ground are enabling the re-establishment of security and, consequently, the gradual return of the people to their areas of origin and the resumption of economic and social activity in the regions previously affected by terrorist actions, through the implementation of the Cabo Delgado reconstruction programme. I therefore wish to express our appreciation to all those who, directly or indirectly, have supported Mozambique in the prevention of and combat against terrorism by providing humanitarian assistance and rebuilding the economic and social fabric of the affected areas.
At the service of the Security Council as a non-permanent member, I reaffirm Mozambique’s commitment to the principles and objectives of the United Nations. We will listen to and work in close collaboration and coordination with all Member States."

Since attaining our political independence 32 years ago, we are proud of the work we have undertaken towards the second phase of our struggle for economic independence. During this period we have built a strong foundation for our governance architecture with an emphasis on strengthening processes, systems and institutions. Given those advances in effective governance, we are optimistic in our quest to deal with the triple challenges of inequality, unemployment and poverty. Our impact plan, the Harambee Prosperity Plan II, which is accelerating the implementation of our national development plans, is fast-tracking our efforts towards our Vision 2030.
Since my term of office will end on 20 March 2025 and we are a nation with a Constitution that limits the Head of State to two terms, we have set in motion the process for an orderly succession to continue with our peaceful development. The ruling party, the South West Africa People’s Organization (SWAPO), which I lead, is currently conducting primaries. There is a real possibility that the next candidate of the SWAPO party for the national presidential elections will be a woman or a young man from the generation that was never in exile. The presence of women in the line of succession is a demonstration of the strides we have made in gender equality, with women’s representation at 40 per cent in the National Assembly. Moreover, 90 per cent of our banks are headed by women. Namibia is a child of international solidarity, midwifed by the United Nations. We therefore believe firmly in solidarity and partnership as critical enablers of our development aspirations.
At this juncture I would like to thank the Secretary- General for his comprehensive report on Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), which makes clear recommendations for advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and all existing global agreements through multilateralism, with the United Nations at the centre of our efforts. I commend the Secretary-General for his visionary leadership in proposing that we should meet in a summit of the future to reflect on the challenges and opportunities that await current and future generations. Namibia supports the convening of that important summit at the earliest opportunity.
Over the past few months, it has been encouraging to see concerted efforts to train a spotlight on transforming education and advancing SDG 4. Education is a sector that Namibia has consistently prioritized through its allocation of resources, both human and financial, and its consistent prioritization of policy development. In the context of the recently concluded Transformation of Education Summit, Namibia commits to transformative leadership, ensuring access to inclusive digital technologies and developing a strategy for innovative financing and resource mobilization. In Namibia, the education sector receives the largest share of budgetary support, equivalent to 8 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and almost a quarter of the total national budget. The Namibian Government offers free primary and secondary education, which demonstrates its commitment to prioritizing and expanding access to education for all. Furthermore, we are proud of the recent landing of the Google Equiano sub-sea cable, which will figure largely in changing Namibia’s digital transformation landscape and narrowing its digital divide, in line with our commitment to leveraging the fourth industrial revolution.
In Namibia, we have set up a fourth industrial revolution task force, which recently made recommendations on how Namibia can strengthen domestic capabilities to derive optimal gains from the fourth industrial revolution. In line with the recommendations of the task force, the Government is currently developing a consolidated national fourth industrial revolution strategy to provide overarching
direction and multisectoral planning. The strategy will prioritize education reform to close the fourth industrial revolution skills gap, as well as cybersecurity and the expansion of the information and communications technology infrastructure and services.
Global debt is at an unprecedented level and interest rates are rising. That reality limits our fiscal space. As we talk about our collective aspirations, we should remain acutely aware of the vulnerabilities facing developing countries. Namibia’s classification as an upper-middle-income country presents challenges with regard to mobilizing resources to finance our development goals.
As I said, taking our GDP and dividing it by our small population, thereby deriving a high per capita income, is without doubt a flawed formula that requires urgent consideration. The formula does not take into account the vast income disparities between the wealthy whites and the poor blacks, which is a consequence of 100 years of colonialism and apartheid occupation. However, I am pleased to hear that a number of developing and developed countries are in agreement on the unfairness of that classification, which denies countries such as Namibia access to soft loans and grants, which are necessary to fight inequality and lift many out of poverty.
The motto for the seventy-seventh session, “Solutions through solidarity, sustainability and science”, calls on us to deal with the issues that affect us all. Therefore, I am confident that the unfair classification of countries such as Namibia as upper- middle-income countries will enjoy priority attention.
Over the past few months, we have witnessed stark geopolitical tensions, a reminder of the fragility of our world order. Threats to peace and security come at great cost to the men, women and children trapped in such situations. The Russia-Ukraine conflict is now in its seventh month, with serious consequences for food and energy supply chains. Namibia believes that dialogue is the condition sine qua non for the peaceful resolution of any conflict. The United Nations was created for the maintenance of peace and security and should lead a peaceful resolution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
Namibia, as a member of the African Union Peace and Security Council and Chairperson of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation, continues to demonstrate its commitment to regional and continental stability by advocating the advancement of infrastructure for peace, democracy and the protection of human rights.
In that regard, as the new Chairperson of the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation, I call for the holding of peaceful general elections in the Kingdom of Lesotho on 7 October. SADC is also seized with developments in the Kingdom of Eswatini and the Republic of Mozambique. In that vein, I have commenced a process of dialogue with the leaders of Eswatini, Lesotho and Mozambique in order to ensure the successful implementation of SADC decisions so that peace and stability may prevail in our region.
I always say that inclusivity spells harmony and exclusivity spells conflict. Africa is a continent of 1.2 billion citizens, and the exclusion of Africa from the Security Council is an injustice. As long as the Council fails to reflect current global realities in its stature and composition, it will not be able to adequately address global concerns. We therefore reiterate our call for the reform of the Security Council, in line with the Common African Position.
Self-determination is a human right. The continued injustices meted out against the people of Palestine are a reminder of the urgent need to start implementing the two-State solution as the only viable alternative that can end inequality and bring peace to the peoples of both Palestine and Israel and indeed the region as a whole.
In the same vein, the lack of progress in implementing United Nations resolutions to resolve the question of Western Sahara should be something for which we all feel collectively ashamed.
Namibia pledges unwavering solidarity for nations that continue to bear the heavy burden of sanctions. Namibia reiterates its long-standing call for the lifting of the unjust embargo against Cuba. I met a 50-year-old Cuban man who has not known anything but sanctions. Since he was born, sanctions were in place. How long will that be continued? If we are talking about building peace in the world, how can a country be sanctioned for such a long time? Children who are born there do not know any other reality except one in which sanctions are imposed. Please, it is time that the sons and daughters of Cuba be given their right to a decent life, free from an embargo that denies them their right to develop their own country. The sanctions should be ended now.
We also call for the lifting of sanctions against the Republic of Zimbabwe. Why are sanctions in place against a country that is making progress at all levels? President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa and the people of Zimbabwe have made laudable progress and reforms, which should be given a chance to succeed without the weight of sanctions.
The health of our planet is in serious jeopardy. Our home is on fire. We are experiencing unprecedented impacts of climate change, including severe droughts and ravaging field fires. Time is a luxury we do not have. We have to act decisively to reduce carbon emissions as our contribution to the preservation of our planet and people.
Namibia, like many developing countries, remains vulnerable to the asymmetrical impacts of climate change. Therefore, at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Namibia plans to announce major developments in its ambitions to decarbonize global hard-to-abate sectors through the production of green hydrogen. Furthermore, the first hydrogen-to-power project in Africa is expected to be operational by 2024 in the town of Swakopmund, Namibia. That is an example of what is possible when we pull together in the same direction.
Our ambitions are necessary not only to mitigate the ravaging impacts of climate change but also as a critical component of our post-pandemic economic recovery. Therefore, Namibia remains ready to work with the international community to ensure the most optimal utilization of its natural resources to combat climate change.
A just energy transition is about providing fair opportunities for developing nations to sustainably access the natural endowments at their disposal. Namibia recently discovered promising deposits of hydrocarbons and is exploring significant deposits of rare Earth metals. As part of our goal to ensure the sustainable utilization of our natural resources, I recently launched the Welwitschia Fund, our nation’s sovereign wealth fund. The fund is a demonstration of our commitment to fiscal prudence and sustainable resource management for current and future generations.
In conclusion, today, on 21 September, we are convened in this Hall on the International Day of Peace to discuss the theme “End racism. Build peace”. Peace is a wonderful gift, but it is a fragile one if it is not handled properly. Peace is more than the absence of war; it is about inclusivity and the development of all nations. Our United Nations, as the premier guarantor of multilateralism, is our best bet for ensuring a peaceful and prosperous humankind.
Namibia will continue to place a high premium on the noble aspirations of the United Nations as a beacon of hope and equality for all nations. As a beneficiary of successful multilateral efforts, we hold in high regard the convening power of the General Assembly and recommit to working with fellow Member States to change the world for the better."

I also express appreciation to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for successfully steering the seventy-sixth session.
My deep appreciation goes to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his commendable efforts to promote global peace, security, human rights and development.
There could have been no better time to deliberate on “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, the theme of this year’s general debate. We are living indeed in a watershed moment — a moment when the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, geopolitical tensions, inequalities and climate crisis threaten our pursuit of peace and prosperity; a moment when the values of solidarity and cooperation are put to test, with trust and confidence in short supply; a moment when humankind is caught between hope and despair, unity and division, and harmony and dissension; and a moment, when the world is striving to forge a new consensus amid competing interests, priorities and challenges.
For the third year in a row, COVID-19 continues to add strain to our lives, livelihoods and economies. But there is hope. The production and availability of COVID-19 vaccines have minimized the risk and severity of the disease and enhanced our ability to save lives. In Nepal, we have been able to fully vaccinate 96 per cent of the target population, with almost everyone receiving at least one dose. We thank our immediate neighbours, India and China, our development partners and the United Nations system for their valuable support.
But that is not the case everywhere. Poor and vulnerable people in many parts of the world have still been kept away from the “dose of hope”. The pandemic will not end unless it ends for all people in all countries. We must ensure vaccine equity so that no one is left behind.
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are at risk. The pandemic has hit our march into the decade of action hard. This has been followed by cascading crises marked by geopolitical divides, the disruption of supply chain and the climate emergency. The resulting high food and fuel price, massive inflation and debt burden have severely hit the limited fiscal capacity of the poorer countries, especially the least developed ones. All these crises have a cumulative negative impact on the financing of the SDGs. It is more acute in the countries in special situations, such as the least developed countries, the landlocked developing countries (LDCs) and the small island developing States.
As per the pre-pandemic estimate, Nepal would require an average annual investment of $19 billion to achieve the SDGs. With the shortfall of financing,
our hard-earned development gains are at risk at a time when we are preparing to graduate from LDC status by 2026. However, graduation is our long-held aspiration, and we remain committed to using this opportunity to bring a structural transformation to the national economy. We will do everything possible to make our graduation process smooth, sustainable and irreversible. For that, we need additional international support in the form of investment, technology transfer, aid for trade and technical assistance. That is critical for us to recover from the pandemic, rescue the SDGs and turn global partnership into a reality.
No country can thrive without integration into the global market. The rising tide of protectionism and stalled trade negotiations are delaying the much-needed reform in the international trading system, which is tipped in favour of some. The poorer countries are yet to benefit from it. We must ensure open, fair and transparent trade rules so that all countries can benefit from it. Similarly, the current global financial system has seriously failed the developing world. It is unfair to continue this undemocratic and unresponsive system. We call for the much-needed reform of international financial architecture and for making it inclusive, fair and equally beneficial to all. The countries under debt stress need urgent debt relief, restructuring and cancellation. The international community must swiftly help them emerge from their debt crises.
In Nepal, we are bearing the disproportionate burden of climate change and facing such climate shocks as frequent landslides, storms, floods and wildfires. The melting of glaciers and the drying-up of snow-fed rivers have been adversely affecting the lives and livelihoods of people downstream and rendering us one of the most vulnerable countries. Our region recently experienced the heartbreaking loss of lives and properties due to unusually heavy downpours, the melting of the glaciers and resulting floods.
To combat the climate crisis and address vulnerabilities, we have localized adaptation plans. While remaining fully committed to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, we have set the ambitious target of reaching a net-zero scenario by 2045, as announced by the Prime Minister of Nepal, The Right Honourable Mr. Sher Bahadur Deuba, at the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
However, climate change is a global problem, and it needs global action. To that end, the large emitters, which account for over 80 per cent of all global emissions, must take bold steps to keep the 1.5°C climate goal alive. The commitment of $100 billion in climate financing must turn into a reality. The twenty- seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change needs to move from pledges into action.
Geopolitics and polarization have pushed global peace and security into peril. The world is becoming more complex with rising transnational challenges such as terrorism, radicalism, extremism and mass migration. Today the world faces the highest number of violent conflicts since 1945, within and between countries, divided by the fault lines of race, religion, ethnicity and origin.
The question that keeps haunting us today is whether enough is being done to protect the people from the scourge of wars by preventing them from happening in the first place. Investment in the prevention of conflicts is more effective than addressing their consequences. Technological advances today have the capacity to inflict devastating physical action instantly, and yet it is appalling to see how our world body gets crippled when it comes to the interplay of the interests of the major Powers in the Security Council.
As our dependence on new technology deepens, the issue of cybersecurity has emerged as one of the greatest challenges that demands our collective resolve to setting norms and building capacity to prevent the threat it poses. We must also put in place the necessary safeguards to curb the malicious use of new technologies. In 2021, global military spending surpassed $2 trillion. Countries are chasing an elusive notion of security by leaving billions of people hungry, sick and destitute. Genuine security depends on the ability to address the underlying causes of conflict: poverty, hunger and unemployment. The stockpiles of nuclear arsenals constitute perpetual threat to humankind. Therefore, their elimination is the only guarantee of the non-use of these weapons in the future.
Nepal reiterates its call for the general and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction, including biological, chemical, nuclear and radiological weapons, in a time-bound manner. Nepal opposes the arms race in outer space and emphasizes the peaceful use of outer space for the benefit of humankind. As the host of the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific, Nepal continues to support regional disarmament initiatives as building blocks of global disarmament. We remain committed to reviving the Kathmandu process, which we believe complements global arms control and disarmament efforts.
Nepal condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and calls for an early conclusion of a comprehensive convention against terrorism.
We are deeply concerned about the deaths and suffering of civilians in the war in Ukraine. We call for an urgent cessation of hostilities and violence, and urge all concerned parties to exercise maximum restraint and return to the path of dialogue. Nepal opposes any threat or use of force against the territorial integrity, political independence and sovereignty of a country under any pretext and circumstance.
Afghanistan has remained on the precipice of uncertainties and violence. The Afghan people are exposed to a shocking level of poverty and humanitarian suffering. We call for unhindered humanitarian aid and public services, including health and education for all sections of Afghan society, to be ensured.
We urge all parties concerned in Myanmar to respect the will of the people to elect their representatives, paving the way to restoring the democratic process.
The people of Libya, Syria and Yemen have been facing hardships and sufferings for too long. The concerned parties need to resort to peaceful means of conflict resolution to end the violence and return to peace.
Protracted violence and conflict continue to inflict pain and suffering on Palestinian and Israeli civilians. Nepal reiterates its long-standing view for a two-State solution, whereby Palestine and Israel will live side by side in peace and security within the recognized international borders.
Nepal pursues the path of a democratic system, with the people’s welfare at the centre. Our democratic process is characterized by the people’s struggle, sacrifice, dialogue and resilience. In May, we successfully held democratic elections to local Governments in a peaceful, free and fair manner. We are now set to hold periodic elections for the federal Parliament and provincial assemblies in November.
For a democracy like Nepal, these are much more than just periodic elections. They are a testament to our ability to ensure the peaceful transfer of power. They are the means to enhance people’s trust in democracy, promote legitimacy and accountability, and strengthen the rule of law. The principles of inclusion and participation constitute the core of Nepal’s governance system. The Constitution of Nepal guarantees the proportional representation and participation of all sections of our society in national life. It guarantees at least 33 per cent representation of women in federal and provincial parliaments and 40 per cent at the local Government level. As a result, the participation of women, youth and disadvantaged groups has increased significantly in politics and other spheres of national life. It has not only ensured their rightful place, but also injected dynamism, justice and fairness into society.
Nepal’s commitment to human rights is unequivocal. The Constitution of Nepal incorporates universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms. As a member of the Human Rights Council for a second consecutive term, Nepal continues to add value to the work of the Council. Our approach to human rights is firmly grounded in the principles of universality, indivisibility, objectivity and non-selectivity.
We are committed to concluding the transitional justice process by addressing the concerns of the victims, complying with the directives of the Supreme Court and abiding by the spirit of Comprehensive Peace Accord and our relevant international commitments. Taking this in earnest, the Government of Nepal has presented an amendment bill to Parliament to reform the related laws.
We uphold the rights of the child as the most sacred obligation of the State, with their protection, well-being, health, education and development at the centre. We attach high importance to the safety, security, dignity and well-being of migrant workers and emphasize the effective implementation of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. We also attach high importance to quality education, skills, entrepreneurship and employment for young people in order to unleash the potential for sustained economic development, peace and prosperity in society. We recognize the significant role that the diaspora can play to bring capital, technology and skills to the country of origin.
Though we are not a party to the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees or its Protocol, we have been hosting thousands of refugees on humanitarian grounds. We believe that the forced eviction of citizens, anywhere and under any circumstances, is a grave crime. Refugees’ right to return to their homeland in safety, honour and dignity must always be ensured.
The cardinal principle of seeing the world as one family shapes our worldview in external relations. Our foreign policy dwells on the notions of peace, non-violence and non-aggression, which find their eloquent expression in the teachings of Gautam Buddha, the enlightened son of Nepal. Nepal enjoys cordial relations with all countries around the world. That is a result of both my country’s historical evolution and the friendly nature of our people. Given the good will Nepal receives from our friends, we feel the need to contribute more to international peace, progress and social justice. We engage with our neighbours and friends in the international community based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, non-alignment, Panchsheel, international law and the norms of world peace. We play active roles in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation and the Asia Cooperation Dialogue to promote regional cooperation.
Our partnership with the United Nations has been built on the foundation of trust and cooperation. We firmly believe in multilateralism, with the United Nations at its centre. With its unmatched coverage, legitimacy and convening power, the United Nations is the most appropriate forum for promoting global cooperation based on sovereign equality and mutual respect. Currently the second-largest troop- and police-contributing country, Nepal has been a consistent contributor to United Nations peacekeeping for the past six and a half decades. We have deployed our peacekeepers at every call and without caveat, even in difficult situations.
Nepal supports all major initiatives aimed at reforming UN peace operations. We have endorsed the Kigali Principles and the Action for Peacekeeping (A4P) and A4P+ initiatives, among others. We have a zero- case policy against sexual exploitation and abuse in peace operations. We condemn targeted attacks against Blue Helmets. The perpetrators of such crimes should be brought to justice. We believe that countries should have fair share of leadership positions at Headquarters and in the field, according to the level and history of their contribution to United Nations peacekeeping.
Nepal supports United Nations reform initiatives, including revitalizing the General Assembly and reforming the Security Council to make it more representative, inclusive and transparent. We also support reform initiatives based on the Secretary- General’s report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982). Those endeavours will not produce results unless the Member States take bold and transformative steps to make our Organization fit for the future. We must enable the United Nations to deliver on the needs of the furthest behind first.
To conclude, the decisions we make today will determine what our future will look like. Our choice to act or not to act will have a huge impact on generations to come. Let us look at what opportunities lie ahead of us. Let us give solidarity and cooperation a chance. As a peace-loving country, Nepal remains committed to contributing to our collective efforts of making this world peaceful, prosperous and equitable."
Netherlands,NLD,Europe,"  17,060,000 ",49254,4.840000153,7.5,82.143,Neoplasm,Cardiovascular Disease,Dementia,2025,11.87,"  17,060,000 ",100.00,11.54,"Growing up in Europe as a child of the Cold War, the Iron Curtain was a fact of life, and I still vividly remember when the first breaches began to appear in the mid-1980s. The credit for that shift, which made a profound impression, is largely due to Mikhail Gorbachev, who passed away a few weeks ago. Although he represented a dogmatic, undemocratic and oppressive system, he had the courage, as a matter of principle, to choose freedom and humanity.
I mention that memory here for a reason. As Russia’s recent past and Mr. Gorbachev’s legacy have shown, we will always have a choice to make. It is the choice between “might is right” and, in the words of the great Dag Hammarskjold, “an international community living in peace under the laws of justice” (A/PV.690, para. 68). That is my message today — working together under the laws of justice is and will remain the only path to a safe and prosperous world. And that is why Russia’s aggression must be stopped.
Right now, Russia stands on the wrong side of history. It is hard not to think of historical analogies in which one powerful country with expansionist ambitions invaded other countries under the false pretence of victimhood and security. Let me be very clear. Russia is not the victim here, it is the aggressor, and the whole world knows it. No one was invading Russia. No one was threatening the Russian people. The people of Ukraine wanted only to be left in peace and to decide their own future. Again, there is only one aggressor here, and that is Russia.
For too long, we assumed that it was pure rhetoric when Mr. Putin said that the end of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe. In hindsight, we all should have paid heed to his words, because they reflect a dangerous worldview. He will not stop at Ukraine if we do not stop him now. This war is bigger than Ukraine itself. It is about upholding the international rule of law. It is about a sovereign people’s right to choose its own path. It is about freedom — theirs and ours. This war is therefore about our common future. And there is only one path for us to follow and one right choice to make. We must uphold the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations — the principles we
agreed to after the painful lessons of history learned from a past aggressor.
This year, NATO and European Union allies are more united than ever in our determination to stop Putin. All States Members of the United Nations should be united in condemning this unprovoked war, because Russia’s unbridled aggression is an assault on the Charter and the international rules-based order. It is an assault on the very foundations of our partnership and therefore an assault on the security of us all.
The Ukrainian people are fighting for their freedom, one stride at a time. I have great admiration for Ukraine’s achievements on the battlefield. Ukraine is gaining ground. This shows that our military assistance is working, and it motivates us to do even more. In the past week, Putin made a speech that can only be described as a sign of panic — a sign of weakness. He is losing his own ill-conceived war, and he knows it. That is why he clutches to his delusional narrative, full of lies and deceit. His words were meant to intimidate, but they leave us cold. Putin’s latest threats to invoke Russia’s nuclear capabilities are intended to sow division in the growing unity that the world is showing. But he will not succeed. Together with our allies, the Netherlands will continue to support Ukraine in any way we can and for however long it takes, every inch of the way.
I therefore call on everyone here — all States Members of the United Nations — to stand firm in defence of the principles we collectively enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and to stand firm until peace, freedom and territorial integrity are fully restored in Ukraine. That must be followed by rebuilding the country and achieving justice for those who have suffered from the war and the crimes and human rights violations arising from it, from sexual violence to deportations, torture and random killings. The horrific crimes committed in Bucha, which I visited, and other places must not go unpunished.
I reiterate that the empty Russian threats leave us cold. But what does not leave us cold is the suffering of the people of Ukraine and, frankly, also the suffering of Russian people, who are being called up against their will to fight. Every week we are seeing more evidence of atrocities, such as those in the recently liberated city of Izyum. The world cannot and will not stand by and do nothing. There can be no justice without accountability.
The Netherlands and the city of The Hague — the legal capital of the world — feel a special responsibility in that regard. We have already supported fact-finding missions by sending forensic experts to Ukraine, in close cooperation with the International Criminal Court. And in July we hosted the Ukraine Accountability Conference, at which 45 countries agreed on key priorities for guaranteeing justice for Ukraine. We know from experience that achieving international justice can be a long and painstaking process.
For more than eight years now, we have been closing in on the Russians responsible for the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH-17 in eastern Ukraine. I am grateful for the unwavering support we have received from Ukraine and many other countries in our fight for justice for the 298 victims and their families. I promise the General Assembly that the Netherlands will continue to work hard to ensure justice for Ukraine as well.
By the same token, we stand firmly with those in Russia who oppose the war, who long for peace and justice, who do not want to send their children into a senseless war and whose voices are not being heard. We will also support those people all over the world who are suffering the effects of the war indirectly. Putin’s war has created not only thousands of victims in Ukraine, but also hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions, of victims of hunger and poverty around the world. Here too, the United Nations family must hold Russia to account.
Putin’s cold-blooded power politics, which exploit the most basic human needs of so many people, provide yet another argument for ending the fossil fuel era even faster than we had planned. They make tackling that other major global issue — climate change — even more urgent. Here too, worldwide cooperation is an absolute must. Together we have all made pledges aimed at keeping global warming below 1.5°C. Around the world, we all feel the urgency of that task.
The Kingdom of the Netherlands, which is made up of four very different countries, is also feeling the effects of climate change, from heavier rainfall and worsening drought in the European part of the Kingdom to more severe hurricanes and rising sea levels in the Caribbean part. Small island developing States are at the forefront of the world’s climate adaptation strategies, and Curasao, Aruba and St. Maarten, the island countries of our Kingdom, are no exception. We are experiencing both the challenges confronting mainland Europe and those that small island States face
every day, including rising ocean temperatures, coral bleaching, biodiversity loss and ocean pollution.
As one Kingdom, we know that water is the factor linking all the great challenges of our time, from food and energy to migration and urbanization. Moreover, 90 per cent of all climate disasters manifest themselves through water via flooding, drought or pollution. Many parts of the world are already facing the reality of having too much or too little water or water supplies that are too polluted. The recent events in Pakistan are a sobering reminder of that: devastating floods that have disrupted the lives of more than 30 million people. That illustrates once again that water is at the heart of many global problems. It has the power to turn our lives upside down and to threaten our health, safety, food and living environments.
But at the same time, collaborating on water issues provides us with a big opportunity to make the world safer, healthier and more prosperous. Investing in water security should be a top priority for our common future because worldwide water solutions are an existential issue and therefore a basic necessity for the world. It is our responsibility to place water security at the core of all our climate action and worldwide efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. That is why the Kingdom of the Netherlands, together with our friends from Tajikistan, will be hosting next year’s United Nations Water Conference. The Conference is all about action — action by Governments and the private sector, working closely across sectors and regions. It can and must be a turning point — it is now or never. I therefore urge everyone to attend.
In the meantime, we will also need to step up our other climate efforts. We will have to rapidly deliver on the promises we made last year in Glasgow. The twenty-seventh Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, will be another milestone, if only because it will mark the first time it will be convened on the African continent. Earlier this month, I met with African leaders in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, at the Africa adaptation summit. Our discussions further impressed on me the importance of climate action for Africa. I can confidently say that the European Union member States remain fully committed to a 55 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 and a swift transition to clean energy.
The Netherlands is also working to combat deforestation and to help the world meet its $100 billion pledge on climate finance. That money must go to the most vulnerable individuals and communities — to those hit hardest by climate change. We will continue to provide expertise and financial support to protect vulnerable areas from the elements. Developed countries have a responsibility to help developing countries take the necessary measures. Only by acting together can we turn things around. That is why the Netherlands will continue pressing for a doubling of finance for climate adaptation. Half of the money that my country spends on international climate action now goes to adaptation and resilience, and we will continue on that path, because adaptation is in our DNA.
In order to address the major issues of our time, we need each other more than ever. Cooperation is the only way forward, with the United Nations as a vital tool — one we must use far more effectively. To quote Dag Hammarskjold once more:
“The United Nations is what the Members make it, reflecting the weakness of all human effort but also the high aspirations and noble achievements of men of good will all over the world.”
That is why the Netherlands supports Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) as a framework for promoting peace, security and sustainable development. We will continue working every day to build broad coalitions to address the major issues of our time — coalitions in which water is our common bond.
In conclusion, together we can and must defend, protect and reinforce the international rules-based order. Putin’s war of aggression must be stopped. We cannot go back to an age of imperialist wars, mass atrocities and mass graves. I want to tell those who are still on the fence that they have a choice. Now is the time to speak out.

Nga mihi maioha ki a koutou katoa, mai i toku Whenua o Aotearoa. Tuia ki runga, Tuia ki raro, ka Rongo to po ka rongo te ao. No reira, tend koutou katoa.
I greet you in te reo Maori, the language of the tangata whenua, or first people, of Aotearoa, New Zealand. I acknowledge the leaders who are here, gathered in person after a long and difficult period. As is tradition in my country, I also acknowledge those who have passed. Loss brings with it a chance for reflection. As leaders, between us, we each represent countries and communities who have lost much in the past few years through famine, severe weather, natural disasters and a pandemic.
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic was devastating. It took millions of lives. It continues to affect our economies and, with that, the well-being of our people. It set us back in our fight against the crisis of climate change and progress on the Sustainable Development Goals while we looked to the health crisis that was right in front of us.
While we enter a period now in which the crisis is subsiding, the lessons cannot. COVID-19 schooled us. It forced us to acknowledge how interconnected and therefore how reliant we are on one another. We move between one another’s countries with increasing ease. We trade our goods and services. When one link in our supply chain is affected, we all are.
The lessons of COVID-19 are, in many ways, the same as the lessons of climate change. When crisis is upon us, we cannot and will not solve these issues on our own. The next pandemic will not be prevented by one country’s efforts, but by all of ours. Climate action will only ever be as successful as the least committed country, as they pull down the ambition of the collective.
However, I am not suggesting that we rely on the goodwill of others to make progress. We need a dual strategy — one in which we push for collective effort but also use our multilateral tools to make progress. That is why, on pandemic preparedness, we support efforts to develop a new global health legal instrument, strengthened international health regulations and a strong and empowered World Health Organization.
It is why we are such advocates of the World Trade Organization and its reform to ensure supply chains remain open and critical goods and services are not subjected to protectionism in times of need. It is why we have worked so hard within the Paris Agreement to see the action we need on climate change, while also doing our bit at home, including by putting a 1.5°C warming limit into law; increasing our nationally determined contribution to 50 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030; and quadrupling our climate finance commitment.
Whether on climate, trade, health crises or seeking peaceful solutions to war and conflict, New Zealand has always been a believer in multilateral tools. We were among the founding members of the United Nations, as Governments of the day recognized that the perils of war would be avoided only through a greater sense of shared responsibility. The basis on which this institution was formed remains as relevant today as it was then. But without reform, we risk irrelevancy.
There is perhaps no greater example of that than Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Let us all be clear: Russia’s war is illegal and immoral. It is a direct attack on the Charter of the United Nations and the international rules-based system and everything that this community should stand for. Putin’s suggestion that Russia could, at any point, deploy further weapons that it has at its disposal reveals the false narrative upon which they have based their invasion. What country that claims to be a liberator threatens to annihilate the very civilians it claims to liberate? The war is based on a lie.
But I recognize that, for the people of Ukraine who have lost loved ones, their sense of peace and security and their livelihoods, these are all just words. They need us, as a global community, to ask one simple question: “What if it were us?” Our ability to answer that question with any confidence in the fact that we have the tools as a global community to act swiftly and collectively has been severely undermined. In March, when we most needed the Security Council to act in the defence of international peace and security, it could not. It did not fulfil its mandate because of one permanent member who was willing to abuse its privileged position. That was wrong.
We will not give up on the ability of our multilateral institutions to stand up against that illegal war or to take on the many challenges we face. Those institutions are the ballast we need, but it is a ballast that requires modernization fit for the tumultuous waters we all face. That is why New Zealand was pleased to champion the veto initiative. Not only does it provide an opportunity to scrutinize the actions of the permanent member who cast a veto, but the veto initiative also gives the whole United Nations membership a voice where the Security Council has been unable to act.
But we continue to call for more than that. For the United Nations to maintain its relevancy and to ensure that it truly is the voice of the breadth of countries it represents, the veto must be abolished, and permanent members must exercise their responsibility for the benefit of international peace and security, rather than the pursuit of national interests.
There are other battles that we continue to wage as a nation, including our call for a global response to the use of nuclear weapons. Our history of championing not just the non-proliferation but the prohibition of nuclear weapons is grounded in what we have witnessed, as well as what we have experienced. We are a nation that is both of the Pacific and within it. It was in our region that those weapons of war were tested. Those tests have left a mark on the people, lands and waters of our home. The only way to guarantee our people that they will be safe from the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons is for them not to exist.
That is why New Zealand calls on all States that share that conviction to join the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Some will call such a position naive. Some believe that we are safer as a result of nuclear weapons. In New Zealand, we have never accepted the wisdom of mutually assured destruction. It takes one country to believe that their cause is nobler, their might stronger or their people more willing to be sacrificed. None of us can stand at this rostrum and turn a blind eye to the fact that there are already leaders among us who believe that.
Nuclear weapons do not make us safer. There will be those who agree, but believe it is simply too hard to rid ourselves of nuclear weapons at this juncture.
There is no question that nuclear disarmament is an enormous challenge, but if given the choice — and we are being given a choice — surely we would choose the challenge of disarmament over the consequences of a failed strategy of weapons-based deterrence. This is why we will continue to advocate for meaningful progress
on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Such progress and consensus was recently blocked by Russia and represented a backwards step in the efforts of nearly every country in the world to make some even limited progress on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
None of that will stop New Zealand’s advocacy. We will remain a strong and passionate advocate for efforts to address the weapons of old, but we will also be an advocate in addressing the weapons that are new. After all, the face of war has changed and, with it, the weapons used. The tools used to challenge the statehood of others are hidden and more complex. Traditional combat, espionage and the threat of nuclear weapons are now accompanied by cyberattacks, prolific disinformation and the manipulation of entire communities and societies.
As leaders, we have never treated the weapons of old in the same way as those that have emerged. That is understandable. After all, a bullet takes a life, and a bomb takes out a whole village, while a lie online or from a podium does not. But what if that lie, told repeatedly and across many platforms, prompts, inspires or motivates others to take up arms, threaten the security of others or turn a blind eye to atrocities, or worse, to become complicit in them? What then? This is no longer a hypothetical. The weapons of war have changed, they are upon us and they require the same level of action and activity that we put into the weapons of old.
We recognized the threats that the old weapons created. We came together as communities to minimize those threats. We created international rules, norms and expectations. We never saw that as a threat to our individual liberties — rather, it was a preservation of them. The same must apply now as we take on those new challenges.
In New Zealand, we deeply value our right to protest. Some of our major social progress has been brought about by hikoi or people power, including becoming the first country in the world to recognize women’s right to vote and movement on major indigenous and human rights issues, to name but a few.
Upholding those values in a modern environment translates into protecting a free, secure and open Internet in order to realize all of the opportunities that it presents in the way we communicate, organize and gather. But that does not mean the absence of transparency, expectations or even rules, if we correctly identify what it is we are trying to prevent. Surely we can start with violent extremism and terrorist content online.
On 15 March 2019, New Zealand experienced a horrific terrorist attack on its Muslim community. More than 50 people were killed as they prayed. The attack was live-streamed on a popular social media platform in an effort to gain notoriety and to spread hate. At that time, the ability to thwart those goals was limited, and the chances of Government alone being able to resolve that gap was equally challenging. That is why, alongside President Emmanuel Macron of France, we created the Christchurch Call to Action. The Call to Action community has worked together to address terrorism and violent extremist content online.
As that important work progresses, we have demonstrated the impact we can have by working together collaboratively. We have improved crisis reactions, stymieing the ability to live-stream attacks and have crisis protocols that kick in to prevent proliferation. We are also focused on prevention and understanding those interactions between online environments and the real world that can lead to radicalization. This week we launched an initiative alongside companies and non-profits to help improve research and understanding of how a person’s online experiences are curated by automated processes. That will also be important in understanding more about misinformation and disinformation online — a challenge that we, as leaders, must address.
Sadly, I think it is easy to dismiss this problem as one in the margins. I can certainly understand the desire to leave it to someone else. As leaders, we are rightly concerned that even the most light-touch approaches to disinformation could be misinterpreted as being hostile to the values of free speech we value so highly.
But while I cannot tell you today what the answer is to that challenge, I can say with complete certainty that we cannot ignore it. To do so poses an equal threat to the norms we all value. After all, how do we successfully end a war if people are led to believe that the reason for its existence is not only legal, but noble? How do we tackle climate change if people do not believe it exists? How do we ensure the human rights of others are upheld, when they are subjected to hateful and dangerous rhetoric and ideology?
The weapons may be different, but the goals of those who perpetuate them are often the same: to cause chaos and reduce the ability of others to defend themselves; to disband communities; and to collapse the collective strength of countries that work together.
But we have an opportunity here to ensure that those particular weapons of war do not become an established part of warfare. Therefore, we once again come back to the primary tool we have: diplomacy, dialogue and working together on solutions that do not undermine human rights, but that enhance them. For those who have not sought out the Christchurch Call to Action, I ask that they consider it. As with so many of the challenges we face, we will only be as strong as those who do the least.
In these times, I am acutely aware of how easy it is to feel disheartened. We are facing many battles on many fronts. But there is cause for optimism, because for every new weapon we face, there is a new tool to overcome it. Every attempt to push the world into chaos is a collective conviction to bring us back to order. We have the means; we just need the collective will."

We come to speak on behalf of a heroic, dignified, sovereign, free people who, together with so many other heroic, dignified, sovereign and free peoples of the planet, have been demonstrating and exercising our national dignity and sovereignty, faced over centuries with the avarice and colonial and imperial greed that have raged, from Europe and the north of this wounded continent, attacking, intervening in, invading and occupying our sacred lands.
The invaders have been expelled from Nicaragua and defeated by the bravery of Nicaraguan patriotism. Our own courage has also been inspired by the great revolutionary and evolutionary liberation struggles of the admirable peoples of this world.
In these times of brazen and violent greedy, ambitious, avaricious practices, of absurd political pretence, and their notorious, spiteful media farces, as they seek to seize our freedoms, our natural and cultural heritage, so as to impose — although they will not succeed in doing so — a global society governed and administered by those who have committed and flaunted their criminality with horrifying and stunning shamelessness amid the most tremendous looting of the riches of our common home.
The assault, the robbery, the disgraceful, abominable depredation, the looting and the genocides unleashed by the colonialists and imperialists of the Earth are real crimes, and their perpetrators are the true criminals against humanity. We denounce them in those terms.
In speaking on this final day of the general debate of the seventy-seventh session, we do so with our heads held high and our hearts full of freedom- loving, fraternal solidarity, espousing lasting justice and peace, and sovereignty and independence that must be respected, as well as the character — a great deal of character, a great deal of mettle, a great deal of heart — to defend what is ours. We speak the language of a human community that demands recognition of our particularities, our models and ways of life, our creeds and beliefs, in accordance with our own history, tradition and aspirations, which we must make victorious, because life is made up of effort, anxieties, searching and demands, of respect from each to all, and from all to everyone.
It is time to do more to make a reality the right of the peoples to a United Nations that represents us all and does not submit to the designs of any imperialist Power.
It is time to assert a world of dialogue and peace, of justice and solidarity, of brotherhood and sisterhood and genuine, true goodwill, coming together despite our differences and enriching our consensus.
It is time to assert our multiple voices, our demands, our causes, which can no longer be ignored or buried under piles and mountains of idolatry and indifference.
It is time to transcend the selfishness that kills millions of human beings through the world, subjecting them to the cruelty of poverty and extreme poverty out of the barbaric, animal-like instincts of the great Powers, which seek to sustain and even perpetuate their domination at the cost of hunger, ill health, climatic destruction, ignorance, war and all the darkness derived from hatred.
It is time to continue rejecting criminal blockades, all the illegal, arbitrary, illicit aggressions called sanctions, which highlight the prevailing perversion of an imperialist and capitalist system and model that seeks to continue imposing punishments, bleeding the world dry, in full view and with the patient complacency of the organisms that should defend it.
It is time to say, “enough” to the lack of common sense, compassion and spirituality, to the appalling and utter disregard of the human condition and soul. It is time to say “enough is enough”, to rebel and continue to rebel against the innate evil of capitalism, which suffocates the majority while brutally enriching the few. Enough is enough.
It is time to say “enough” to the hypocritical imperialism that politicizes, falsifies and denigrates the very human rights that they themselves violate and deny on a daily basis, imperialism and its coercive actions against life in all its spheres, which are contrary to international law in and of themselves.
It is time to stop, with the help of everyone, the invasions, aggressions and occupations affecting so many territories made for the glory of God, in the name of the right to a safe, harmonious life, with rights, with decent work, with food and sustainable and viable means to be able to affirm the well-being and happiness that we deserve.
It is time to denounce and put an end to the capital sins used to justify intervention and interference in the internal domestic affairs of each country. And it is time to assert the freedom to be ourselves and not what others — who demand, who wage war, seeking to displace us and continue to occupy us so as to plunder our cultural and natural riches — want us to be.
It is time to enforce the principle of the sovereign equality of States in all international organizations and forums, so that this multipolar, non-aligned world that we have worked so hard to bring about becomes a reality, strengthens and grows while taking all of us into account.
It is time to ensure that the Charter of the United Nations and so many organizations that should serve to bring us together are valid for everyone and respect the rights of everyone. Now is and should be the time of the peoples.
All our countries that have lived through all the fires of greed, avarice, selfishness, the vainglory of vanities and the search for absolute dominion by others over a world that does not belong to them must strengthen and consolidate our identities and consensus, together defending culture and justice based on respect and peace in all relevant spaces.
We support and embrace with commitment dignified and brave Venezuela, with heroic Cuba, with the historic and noble battles of the Palestinian people, with the Islamic revolution of the Iranian families; the continuing great battle of the Russian Federation against fascism and for security, integrity and peace, which will continue, we have no doubt, to gather victories.
We embrace with solidarity the admirable resistance and just development of the People’s Republic of China, which generates so much discomfort, concern and envy among the enemies of the common good.
It is time to remain united with Syria, with the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, with Belarus, with the peoples of Asia, of Africa, of our America and the Caribbean, fighting all the magnificent, momentous struggles that we are sure will result in the most sublime and supreme triumph of all time — a new world that is now indispensable and cannot be postponed!
In Nicaragua, there is a patriotic nation, and because there is a patriotic nation, there is peace. In the name of our generals of free men and women, Augusto Sandino and Benjamin Zeledon, national heroes, heroes of anti-imperialism who fill our hearts with the resolve to fight and continue to overcome; in the name of our infinite father of metaphor, dreams and realities both worldly and heavenly, our magical teacher, the great Ruben Dario, we greet each and everyone here and call on us all to continue fighting for justice, peace and the inalienable rights of our peoples, life, health, strength, hope and faith in the future. A better world, multipolar, just, ethical, spiritually and materially, is already being born, and we are here to continue its creation and to defend it.
The sovereignty of a people is not a matter for discussion, but to be defended, with love and the sacred flames of celestial hopes."
Niger,NER,Africa,"  22,443,000 ",906,0.3540000021,5.2,62.024,Malaria,Diarrheal Disease,Lower Respiratory Infection,1227,5.47,"  4,320,706 ",19.25,2.68,"At the outset, I wish to extend my warm congratulations and wishes for success to Mr. Csaba Korosi on his outstanding election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session. I welcome the leadership and commitment of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to peace and development, climate action, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic response, as well as his sustained efforts to find solutions to the various sources of tension throughout the world.
In this Decade of Action to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals, the climate emergency is creating humanitarian needs and exacerbating existing development challenges. Alarming evidence from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shows that we may have already reached or gone beyond major tipping points and irreversible setbacks. Climate change exposes the African continent to worsening food insecurity, population displacement, recurrent droughts and pressure on water resources. Faced with the urgency of this situation, I welcome the fact that, during the special high-level dialogue on the theme “The Africa We Want”, organized on 20 July 2022 under the auspices of the United Nations, the international community recognized that the twenty- seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP), to be held in November in Egypt, is a unique opportunity to adjust this imbalance. In that regard, I would like to express the Niger’s commitment to the proposal of the African negotiators for a new objective of $1.3 trillion in financing by 2025 to better address climate challenges.
In the Sahel, a geographical area to which my country, the Niger, belongs, climate change, which negatively influences agricultural and pastoral activities and water resources, is also the cause of extreme droughts, torrential rains and temperature increases above the world average. That is why the Niger is paying special attention to the African Great Green Wall initiative, which is part of the African Union Agenda 2063.
In terms of security, the situation in the Sahel and in my country has deteriorated considerably in recent years due to a particularly negative subregional environment. It all started, let us recall, with the fall in 2011 of the regime in Libya, which to this day has been unable to restore a stable power that could exercise real authority over the whole country. Consequently, the vast territory of southern Libya has become a platform for transnational organized crime where the trafficking of arms, drugs, fuel and migrants prosper, perpetuating structural insecurity in all neighbouring Sahelian countries.
Mali, which in 2011 succumbed to the violence that originated in Libya, has never really recovered. It has in turn become an incubation centre for a form of terrorism that is characteristic of a Sahel that is deeply affected by the effects of climate change preventing the practice of pastoral farming. That ecosystem of violence has had a deadweight effect on the young shepherds of the communities most affected by climate change, among whom a number of terrorist vocations have arisen. This scourge has spread from northern Mali to the Niger and Burkina Faso and is now attempting to spread to the countries of the Gulf of Guinea. The violence has such potential to destabilize State institutions that it resulted in the downfall of the democratically elected regimes of Mali and Burkina Faso in 2020 and 2022, respectively. The Niger, my country, in addition to the terrorist hotbed known as the three-borders region — Mali, the Niger and Burkina Faso — is also facing another terrorist hotbed in the Lake Chad basin, where the various groups that claim to be part of the shadowy Boko Haram operate.
Despite the strong pressures related to the circumstances I have just described, my country is showing great resilience centred on very wise governance, the promotion of a culture of tolerance and community cohesion, as well as the rules of democracy and the rule of law. It was that resolute choice of rights and freedoms that made it possible to organize transparent elections that sanctioned the first change of Head of the State by virtue of which a democratically elected President passed the baton to another democratically elected President in April 2021. Need it be said that our experience proves that the surest way to ward off the effects of terrorist violence is to strengthen the democratic regime and nothing else?
The war against terrorism now requires us to devote significant resources to increasing the numbers of our forces, acquiring adequate equipment and building the capacities of our soldiers. Allow me to take this opportunity to thank the various partners engaged with us in the fight against terrorism. I would particularly like to thank France, whose action through Operation Barkhane is a major asset in the struggle against our
enemies. I also thank the United States of America, the Federal Republic of Germany and all the other countries committed alongside us in various ways, all equally valuable.
That being said, I find it crucial to point out that the international community’s commitment to the fight against terrorism in the Sahel has shortcomings that need to be identified and addressed. Indeed, this terrorism derives a large part of its financial resources from trans-Saharan drug trafficking towards Europe and Asia, via Libya. Most of the weapons flooding the Sahel terrorist violence market also come from Libya. I believe that we are faced with a problem that is not particularly complicated. Why then has it not yet been possible to set up an adequate system with the necessary means to combat this phenomenon properly? It is indeed time for collective reflection. It is time for the great Powers present in that region and the international community as a whole to join the countries of our region in a far more relevant reflection to define an effective course of action in the fight against drug and arms trafficking in the Sahel.
Despite the major challenges we face, as described earlier, the Niger intends to remain a solid and stable State, backed by democratic institutions, and resolutely committed to the fight against poverty and for development. Our deep conviction in that regard is that the most effective means of combating poverty consists in promoting education. The development challenges for the Niger are summarized by the following simple statistics: an annual population growth rate of 3.9 per cent; an average synthetic fertility index of seven children per woman; a first birth for nearly 50 per cent of girls before the age of 15; and 50 per cent of the population aged 15 on average. Those statistics say much about the state of the education system in our country, and that is why we are committed to act with determination to improve things in this area. As such, the agenda based on which the people of the Niger elected us aims to take action on two fronts: improving access to and the quality of education.
With regard to quality, we have decided to place particular emphasis on the quality of teacher training and the professionalization of teaching. With regard to improving access, our policy emphasizes the building of school infrastructure. The other particularly important aspect of our educational programme that I wish to emphasize is aimed at achieving gender equity and building residential facilities for girls in rural schools.
Indeed, because of the precarious living conditions of children in rural schools, far from their parents, the latter tend to prevent their daughters from continuing their studies. These adolescents are given in marriage as soon as they are out of the education system, which explains some of the previously mentioned statistics. In offering girls the tranquility and security desired by their parents, residential facilities also offer girls conditions in which to continue their studies with the possibility of staying in school and acquiring the necessary academic and professional skills. The large-scale expansion of residential facilities for girls in rural schools contributes to improved education-system performance and a reduction in the rate of population growth.
My reason for highlighting our ambitions in the field of education for a country like the Niger, after having spoken about climate change, terrorism and insecurity in the Sahel, is that we are aware that these three issues — demography, climate change and insecurity — are closely related. Indeed, the terrorism currently at work in the Sahel is connected to the living conditions of certain communities whose environment has been considerably disrupted by climate change. The Sahel is also an area that has experienced particularly high population growth in recent decades. The combination of these two phenomena — demography and climate degradation — has created, as a result of the regional disorder following the fall of Colonel Al-Qaddafi’s regime in 2011, the situation of chaos that the countries of the Sahel are experiencing today.
That is why it is not enough for the United Nations and the international community to be moved by or to discuss terrorist violence at length. We must act by investing the necessary resources in education to combat the violence of today and prevent the violence of tomorrow."
Nigeria,NGA,Africa,"  195,875,008 ",5323,7.043000221,5.3,54.332,Lower Respiratory Infections,Neonatal Disorder,HIV/AIDS,7019,3.58,"  108,514,757 ",55.40,5.04,"On behalf of the Government and the people of Nigeria, I congratulate the President on his well-deserved election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session and assure him of the full support and cooperation of the Nigerian delegation during his tenure. I commend his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for the Assembly’s many remarkable achievements under his leadership during these challenging times. I would also like to congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, on his ceaseless and untiring efforts to promote peace, security and development, which are very much in line with his exalted role.
The first time I might have been able to address the Assembly was in 1984, when I was the Military Head of State of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Some 31 years later, in 2016, I had the great privilege to personally address the Assembly as the democratically elected President of my country (see A/71/PV.4 A). As I approach the end of my second and final four- year term, I am reminded of how much has changed in Nigeria, Africa and the world, and yet how some challenges remain. We are now more severely tested by our enduring and our new global challenges, paramount among which are conflicts that are increasingly being driven by non-State actors, the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, terrorism, violent extremism, the malignant use of technology, climate change, irregular migration and disparities in opportunities for improved standards of living.
Despite the challenging international environment, the United Nations has proved that it can be strong when the will of its members is harnessed for positive, collective action. The guiding principle of this extraordinary institution is the promotion of peace and security, development and human rights. The latest in a chain of events challenging those principles is the conflict in Ukraine, which has already created strains that may be unprecedented for an entire generation. Such a conflict will have adverse consequences for us all, hindering our capacity to work together to resolve conflicts elsewhere, especially in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Indeed, the ongoing war in Ukraine is making it more difficult to tackle the perennial issues that feature each year in the deliberations of the Assembly, such as nuclear disarmament, the right of Rohingya refugees to return to their homes in Myanmar, Palestinians’ legitimate aspirations for statehood and the reduction of inequalities within and among nations.
The danger that the war in Ukraine will escalate further justifies Nigeria’s resolute calls for a nuclear- free world and a universal Arms Trade Treaty, which are also necessary measures for preventing global human disasters. In that regard, we must find a way to reach a rapid consensus on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, with related commitments by the nuclear-weapon States. I remain firmly convinced that the challenges that have come so sharply into focus in recent years and months emphasize the call by Nigeria and many other Member States for reform of the Security Council and other United Nations agencies. We need a more effective and representative structure to meet today’s demands, which have outgrown a system designed for the very different world that prevailed at its foundation in 1945. Change is long overdue.
This is the first meeting that we are having here in New York without the restrictions that characterized the past three years. The coronavirus disease pandemic ripped across national borders like a toxic whirlwind, leaving in its wake a legacy of pain and loss. Happily, we also witnessed an incredible level of innovation and creativity from those who devised treatments and vaccines. Those laudable achievements were underpinned by partnerships and international cooperation. We also saw the bravery, care and endurance of health professionals in every corner of the globe. With the coronavirus, we saw very clearly how States tried to meet the challenge of a threat that could not be contained within national borders. The results were mixed, but at its best, the cooperation among stakeholders was outstanding. It facilitated solutions that saved countless lives and eased a huge burden of human suffering. That same theme of multilateralism, as the promotion of national interests competes with the common cause in the face of an existential threat, has been our recurring experience in recent times.
In every address that I have delivered to the Assembly, I have dwelt on the issue of climate change, especially as it fuels conflicts and complicates food security. Climate change reduces opportunity and prosperity, which in Africa, Latin America and some parts of Asia also contributes to transnational organized crime. Last year, as part of Nigeria’s effort to achieve our global net-zero aspirations, my Administration adopted
a national climate-change strategy that aims to deliver climate-change mitigation in a sustainable manner. The measures we took at the national level also require climate justice. Compared to industrialized economies, Africa and other developing nations produce only a small proportion of greenhouse-gas emissions. Yet we are the hardest hit by the consequences of climate change, as we are seeing in the sustained drought in Somalia and the unprecedentedly severe floods in Pakistan. Those and other climate-related occurrences are now suddenly becoming commonplace in the developing world. In effect, we are literally paying the price for policies that others pursue. That must change.
At the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Glasgow last year, I said that Nigeria was not asking for permission to make the same mistakes that others have made in creating the climate emergency. Fortunately, we now know what we can do to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis and the related energy challenges. As a first step, we must all commit to releasing the financing and the technology for creating a stable and affordable framework for energy transmission. Financial development institutions must prioritize de-risking energy projects to improve renewable projects’ access to credit facilities. No country should be left behind in that area. The skyrocketing energy costs worldwide are in part the product of conflict and supply disruptions to Europe and the Americas, yet we are all paying the price. It is therefore our expectation that the seventy- seventh session of the General Assembly and the upcoming COP 27 will help galvanize the political will required to drive action towards fulfilling the various existing climate change initiatives.
Another feature of the past decade has been the growing partnerships between States and increasingly influential non-State actors. There was a time when the most important events at the Assembly featured statements by the world’s most powerful leaders. Now, a tweet or Instagram post by an influencer on a social or environmental issue may have a greater impact. Technology offers us limitless opportunities and sometimes runs ahead of the imagination of regulators and legislators. At its best, social media helps strengthen the foundation of our society and our common values. At its worst, it is a corrosive digital version of the mob, bristling with intolerance and division. In confronting those challenges, we must also come together to defend freedom of speech while upholding other values that we cherish. We must continue to work for a common standard that balances rights with responsibilities to keep the most vulnerable from harm and help strengthen and enrich communities. Efforts to protect communities from the scourge of disinformation and misinformation must also be matched with efforts to reduce inequalities and restore hope to the poorer and most vulnerable members of our communities, as a means to curb the many socioeconomic conflict drivers that we face.
In spite of our efforts, humanitarian crises will continue to ravage some of our communities. Nigeria therefore implores its global partners to do more to complement its endeavours. Indeed, the multifaceted challenges facing most developing countries have left a debilitating chokehold on their fiscal space. That equally calls for addressing the burden of unsustainable external debt via a global commitment to the expansion and extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative to countries facing fiscal and liquidity challenges, as well as outright cancellation for countries facing the most severe issues.
Democracy is an idea that crosses time and borders. Sadly, it has its limitations. The wheels of democracy turn slowly. It can demand compromises that dilute decisions. Sometimes it bends too much to special interests that exercise influence, not always for the general good, in a manner disproportionate to their numbers. However, it has been my experience that a democratic culture provides a Government with the legitimacy it needs to deliver positive change. In Nigeria, not only have we worked to strengthen our democracy, but we have also supported it and promoted the rule of law in our subregion. In the Gambia, we helped guarantee the first democratic transition since independence. In Guinea-Bissau, we stood by the democratically elected Government when it faced mutiny. In Chad, following the tragic death on the battlefield of its President, the late Idriss Deby Itno, we joined forces with its other neighbours and international partners to stabilize the country and encourage a peaceful transition to democracy, a process that is ongoing. We believe in the sanctity of constitutional term limits, and we have steadfastly adhered to them in Nigeria. We have seen the corrosive impact on values when leaders elsewhere seek to change the rules to stay in power. Indeed, we are now preparing for general elections in Nigeria, scheduled for February. At the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly, there will be a new face on this rostrum speaking for Nigeria.
Ours is a vast country, strengthened by its diversity and common values of hard work, enduring faith and a sense of community. We have invested heavily to strengthen our framework for free and fair elections, and I thank our partners for all the support that they have provided for our elections. As President, I have set the goal that one of the enduring legacies I would like to leave is to entrench a process of free, fair, transparent and credible elections by which Nigerians elect the leaders of their choice.
The multiple challenges that we face are truly interconnected and urgent, and the choice of this session’s theme, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, is apt. In keeping with our obligations as Member States of the Organization, we must all do our utmost to work with the President to resolve them. In that regard, I reiterate my delegation’s full and resolute cooperation.
Let me convey my final reflections from this famous rostrum. We live in extraordinary times, with interdependent challenges, but enormous opportunities. The pace of change can seem bewildering, with sometimes a palpable and unsettling sense of uncertainty about our future. But if my years in public service have taught me anything, it is that we must keep faith with those values that endure. They include, but are not limited to, such values as justice, honour, integrity, ceaseless endeavour and partnership within and between nations. Our strongest moments have always been those in which we remain true to the basic principles of tolerance, community and abiding commitment to peace and goodwill towards all."
North Macedonia,MKD,Europe,"  2,083,000 ",13887,22.37999916,5.2,75.688,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,196,9.41,"  2,083,000 ",100.00,7.30,"Our strength is in our unity. That lesson — that together we can achieve much more than we can alone — is a lesson that the world of today is learning in circumstances unanticipated in the twenty- first century: first the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, and now the cruel war in Ukraine. Now and in the future, the democratic world needs unity in overcoming the global consequences that the countries of Europe and worldwide are facing.
At the onset of the joint and united efforts made in response to the start of the war, the Republic of North Macedonia immediately and decisively aligned itself with European Union foreign policy and that of the democratic world. We joined global efforts in response to the war as a country committed to peace and to finding dialogue-based solutions and fully dedicated to European values. In doing so, we relied on our own experience and lessons learned, according to which peace, strength and progress can be achieved only with unity. We learned this lesson both when we peacefully declared independence in 1991, and in 2001 when we rose above internal inter-ethnic conflict, while today we rely on our experience in pursuing our established concept of “One society for all”, thereby setting an example of a functional, multi-ethnic democracy, while serving as a significant factor for stability in the Western Balkans and consequently in Europe,
which makes us a reliable partner of the international democratic community.
Functional solutions that work in a small area always serve as a road map to finding solutions in the global setting. No matter how many challenges arise in a given wide geographic area, they tend to erupt in a certain smaller area, only later becoming a potential global threat. That point of eruption today is an independent and sovereign State — Ukraine — whose citizens are faced with an unacceptable and unjustifiable aggression by the Russian Federation.
There are two especially concerning aspects that demand our full attention. One is related to the fact that a permanent member of the Security Council — the Russian Federation — committed the aggression. The fact that a country has decided to resolve a challenge using force — despite being a Member of an Organization founded on a commitment to preserving world peace — runs contrary to all endeavours and commitments of the civilized world to put an end to all forms of action that cause loss of human life and jeopardize the global peace. Furthermore, the demonstration of force by a geographically larger country against a geographically smaller country that is committed to fostering and sharing democratic values is a dangerous and impermissible precedent. In simple terms, everything must be done to prevent that from becoming a practice in this world we share, where there are geographically smaller and bigger countries.
As we can see, problems are multidimensional and affect us all. These are the challenges we will all face in the winter ahead, the most severe since the Second World War — to ensure the availability of food and energy for our citizens. Therefore, we must search for solutions while acting in unison. Our response or solutions to interlocking challenges is the essential topic of this debate — that solutions are to be found in solidarity and must be sustainable and science-based.
Speaking of sustainability, I believe that we should take into consideration another bitter experience from the war in Ukraine. The struggle for peace is ongoing and peace requires continual dedication to mutual understanding, vigilance and prompt action.
I should like to convey a clear message from my country. The unprovoked aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine is a gross violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of international legal norms and principles. The aggression cannot be justified or relativized. The Russian Federation must put an immediate end to the aggression and withdraw its troops from Ukraine. History teaches us that no problem can be resolved by using force. Putting an end to the aggression is the necessary precondition to opening the only feasible way of finding a solution, namely, diplomacy and dialogue. The latter can and must be the sole mechanism for settling disputes and resolving differences between countries.
The uncertainty of the food and energy supply will deepen differences at the global level between the rich North and the poor South and bring millions of people to the brink of adversity, even threatening them with hunger. We will all — the economically more developed and economically less developed countries alike — feel the impact. We must rely on lessons learned from the pandemic. International solidarity should not be guided by whether it is needed among the better developed countries or among the less developed. That is especially true if we want to prevent the rise of new challenges ensuing from the growing dissatisfaction of citizens in global terms.
The pandemic has reminded us that we are all equal when faced with a common and, in this case, invisible enemy that has cost millions of human lives worldwide. The pandemic has also brought to light the importance of solidarity and unity, transposed into concrete, intentional cooperation. These are the principles that should guide our future actions when we face present and future challenges.
In the specific context of overcoming the consequences of the war in Ukraine, it is necessary to redouble our efforts to enhance international solidarity and mutual assistance on an equal footing, both in the European Union, where the impact of the Ukraine war is greatest, and worldwide. This applies in particular to finding viable solutions to overcoming challenges related to the supply of both energy and food. In that context, I underscore the important active role of Secretary-General Guterres and that of Tiirkiye’s mediation in the exportation of wheat from Ukraine.
Developments in and surrounding Ukraine have pushed numerous other conflicts worldwide into the background. However, the focus on such conflicts must remain sharp. Terrorism in all its forms is still a global threat to all humankind. Numerous hybrid threats are a cause of great concern and distress. Fake news and the opportunity for social networks to disseminate such
news on a mass scale via the internet are a challenge facing the entire democratic world. Authoritarian tendencies, disguised under the veil of disingenuous patriotism, pose a serious threat to human rights and freedoms and prompt potential instability.
We also face the burning issue of climate change, despite all efforts to put up a joint and united front in saving our planet Earth. The recent catastrophic floods in Pakistan are but one of the latest visible consequences in a series of extreme natural disasters worldwide caused by climate change. Biodiversity loss, air pollution and the lack of water impose themselves as priority threats, not only to the environment and ecosystems, but also to people’s lives. This situation will persist until every individual becomes fully aware that nature is not ours but is part of us, and that we must treat it as such. All these problems demand concerted action, founded on intensified and consolidated efforts focused both on prevention and on finding solutions.
Conflicts, instability, violence and climate change cause the spread of grave poverty for millions of people, as well as population displacements that are growing into an exodus. The waves of migration we have faced in recent years from Syria and Afghanistan are not winding down. Now, we also have millions of refugees from Ukraine.
The Republic of North Macedonia has opened its doors to citizens of Ukraine who have been forced to flee their homeland and seek refuge in our country. This is a good opportunity to duly commend countries worldwide that have welcomed the largest number of refugees, as well as the substantial number of citizens throughout the world who work every day to provide care for refugees and help those in need. My country, the Republic of North Macedonia, using its available capacities, remains committed to honouring its international commitments in the humanitarian area. If we are to successfully address and manage diverse forms of immigration, it is necessary to strengthen the awareness that this is a global challenge that necessitates coordinated activities in accordance with the principle of shared responsibility.
We learn from experience that no problem is a minor problem. Every minor problem has the potential to grow into a more difficult and larger-scale problem. However, our coming together here at United Nations Headquarters serves as a good reminder that strength and solutions can be achieved when we unite in support of genuine values. Multilateralism and respect for established rules and obligations, starting with the United Nations Charter, are the only way of providing the much-needed predictability in international relations.
We are building our future now, today and together. Despite all the deficiencies of international mechanisms, multilateralism and the United Nations, as its most visible and recognized form, endowed with the universal mission of preserving the peace, are still the key important catalysts encouraging joint efforts towards a better, safer and more just world.
Global challenges require a global response. No country can deal with twenty-first century problems on its own. Now more than ever, we need to demonstrate that multilateralism works and gives results in times of crisis. In that context, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) is to be our road map in pursuing global governance reforms that would open the way for the United Nations multilateral central system to adapt to the future and be able to contribute to joint endeavours.
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of course remains the starting point in pursuing global action. The Agenda not only addresses the chronic and persistent problems of poverty and inequitable development, but can also serve as a platform for finding solutions to all other problems, starting with the need for us to unite behind a new agenda for peace, while placing the human dimension in the focus of technological development in the digital era.
The Republic of North Macedonia is working intensively to accomplish the Sustainable Development Goals and supports all efforts aimed at making the United Nations stronger and more efficient. In pursuing the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as other development activities in the national, regional and global settings, we need to ground ourselves on the premise that we owe it to young generations to provide them with the conditions for progress.
Young people, their access to modern, forward- looking education and the resolution of problems they face must be at the centre of our attention and of our political engagement in the coming years. In that respect, I should like to emphasize that, for the second consecutive year, a youth representative from the Republic of North Macedonia is participating in the work of the General Assembly.
On 1 January 2023, the Republic of North Macedonia will have the honour of assuming the chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the largest regional security organization. This brings great responsibility, especially in light of the fact that my country will be taking over the OSCE chairmanship at a time when there is a military aggression in Europe, along with all ensuing consequences for peace and security in the OSCE area and beyond. Nevertheless, I am confident that we will successfully justify the trust bestowed upon us. North Macedonia has at times been the beneficiary of mediation-security mechanisms, including a United Nations peace mission, and has had first-hand experience of the benefits of the peacebuilding efforts of the international community. Relying on such experience, we stand ready to contribute to strengthening and developing security in the wider context. As the 2023 OSCE Chair, we will be fully committed to the noble mission of serving peace and security as a precondition for economic and social development, and I am confident that we will contribute to advancing multilateral security mechanisms.
Our confidence is based on our practice of living together in unity and on the related benefits in the national, regional and international contexts. Today in this Hall, I represent a country in which all ethnic communities have equal, constitutionally guaranteed rights and obligations. We are working to make the Republic of North Macedonia a civic, democratic society in which differences are regarded as an enriching advantage, and not as an obstacle. Standing united as a multi-ethnic, functional democracy, today we are a successful example of a mini-Europe in the Balkans.
However, bearing in mind the significance of mutual understanding, respect and support, which prompt and motivate unity, working together with our two neighbours, Albania and Serbia, we have established the Open Balkan initiative. Today, the initiative has grown into a successful example of regional interconnectivity. It has also contributed to our shared commitment to removing unnecessary barriers to the movement of people, trade, the transport of goods and the provision of services. In the present circumstances, the initiative has enabled us to ensure the availability of food for our citizens, based on our agreement to help each other if faced with food shortages in our respective domestic markets as a consequence of the global crisis. We have further agreed that there will be no bans on trade in basic agricultural and food products. We are also intensively considering options for cross-border trade in electricity and providing assistance with various energy sources as part of our effort to overcome the serious energy situation the entire world is facing.
We are also developing good-neighbourly relations with a keen sense of responsibility and through dialogue, convinced that safeguarding national and State interests does not run contrary to broader integration processes and advanced cooperation with countries in our neighbourhood. Quite the contrary, self-affirmation finds its most relevant and appropriate reflection in a wider community of shared values.
Guided by these policies of building bridges, while employing functional diplomacy, dialogue and understanding, we have succeeded in accomplishing the strategic goal of becoming part of NATO, and today we are a proud, fully-fledged member of the Alliance. Seventeen long years after we were granted European Union (EU) membership candidate status, we have started accession negotiations with the EU. My country attaches particular importance to our speedy EU integration. We are working with dedication and persistence to undertake all the steps required for the accomplishment of my country’s second strategic goal.
The citizens of North Macedonia have waited far too long for this moment, and I acknowledge and understand their frustration and fatigue on this long road to Europe. But we have no alternative path to reaching our goal of better living standards. No one promised that the road would be an easy one. Indeed, despite the difficulties, the EU still represents the best option for our future and that of our children. We have neither the opportunity nor the privilege to abandon it. Now is the time to maintain full speed ahead and even redouble our pace.
I would like to underscore that the EU membership of the Republic of North Macedonia is of essential importance also to the European Union itself, especially in the new circumstances of the global context, in which such a message of encouragement that the enlargement process continues and awaits the entire region, which, regardless of its progressive leadership, is not immune to global challenges. This is especially true in conditions in which the European integration and democratic path of the Western Balkan countries should and must be ensured as a contribution to European peace.
The story of my homeland, the Republic of North Macedonia, which two weeks ago celebrated 31 years of independence, is a story of peace, cooperation and understanding, through which it was established while dealing with challenges and overcoming threats both to our internal stability and on our way to international integration. I therefore underline that we are solution-oriented, working together to face challenges that do not recognize State borders or ethnic, linguistic, religious or any other differences.
I am especially honoured and pleased that, as Prime Minister of the Republic of North Macedonia, I have the opportunity to addressing Members for the first time here at the United Nations, the Organization that is the guardian of peace, solidarity and prosperity.
I would like to offer my appreciation to Mr. Abdulla Shahid, President of the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session, for his successful work. I am confident that Mr. Csaba Korosi, who has assumed the presidency of the Assembly at the seventy-seventh session, will be equally successful.
The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have brought to light human weaknesses and fragility even in our modern twenty-first century. Yet, as the pandemic has also demonstrated the power of innovation and the ability of science to quickly produce the necessary vaccines, humankind must also continue relying on science and keep believing in its humanistic foundations and capabilities and peace.
We are all in the same boat and we have no other choice except to treat each other with solidarity and work in unity, defending and advancing the fundamental values of freedom and peace throughout the world. Peace is reached by making compromises, but peace is preserved with mutual understanding."
Norway,NOR,Europe,"  5,338,000 ",76397,4.159999847,7.4,82.271,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,633,11.86,"  5,338,000 ",100.00,11.23,"We live in challenging times indeed. As a global community, we face the dire consequences of war, climate change, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, food insecurity and inequality. The Secretary-General underlined that eloquently in his address to the General Assembly (see A/77/PV.4). We have the values and principles necessary to deal with those challenges — they are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. There is no country that does not face those challenges, and we can only successfully respond to them together.
That is precisely why we have the United Nations, which was born out of crisis, to unite our strengths and enable nations to rise above their narrow self-interests and find common ground. That is what we need to turn to again. The United Nations Charter sets out clear principles for a rules-based international order, but now that rules-based order is under attack. February 2022 ushered in what we had hoped we would never witness again — a new large-scale war in Europe. Russia’s unprovoked attack on Ukraine has led to massive suffering, large-scale humanitarian needs and the destruction of civilian infrastructure. Russia bears sole responsibility for the war and its consequences — and Russia is responsible for bringing it to an end.
Russia’s actions are in blatant breach of the United Nations Charter, and therefore concern us all. The war is also having devastating global consequences, as we have heard so many speakers highlight this week. It has undermined multilateral cooperation when we need it the most. It has accelerated a negative economic spiral and jeopardized the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
We are all feeling the repercussions of the war. Energy supply is under pressure, inflation is soaring and food insecurity has increased dramatically. Ordinary people across the globe — not least those in developing countries — are paying the price. The war is amplifying other crises and compounding the impacts of climate change and armed conflict in other parts of the world. The Horn of Africa is faced with its worst drought in more than four decades. Pakistan is contending with devastating floods. More than 300 million people affected by conflicts and humanitarian crises are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection.
There is a lack of respect for international humanitarian law in many armed conflicts, and civilians are paying the price. A few years ago, it appeared that hunger would soon be a scourge of the past; now food insecurity is on the rise. No continent is more vulnerable to the combined effects of climate change, conflict and growing food insecurity than Africa. Norway stands in solidarity with the people grappling with those interlocking crises. We have allocated more funding to humanitarian assistance and development cooperation in 2022 than ever before.
The war of aggression against Ukraine is a challenge to the norms and the founding principles of the United Nations. We are standing up to confront that challenge. Some have the conviction that authoritarian regimes are strong, while democracies are frail and likely to crack under pressure. We are proving them wrong. Together with a strong alliance of partners, we are standing with Ukraine and aiding its self-defence. As Europe’s largest supplier of energy, we do what we can to enhance Europe’s resilience.
We are standing up for human rights and fundamental freedoms elsewhere. Norway will continue to promote civic space, protect human rights defenders and support media diversity and independent journalism worldwide. Women’s and girls’ participation in society and their right to make decisions about their own bodies are essential to democratic and sustainable development, not least in times of conflict and war. Safeguarding those human rights remains one of our top priorities.
While supporting Ukraine, we must not forget conflicts elsewhere. Norway is continuing its peace diplomacy and peacebuilding efforts in major conflicts across the globe. As part of our long-standing engagement in the Middle East, we are pushing for an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including a viable two-State solution.
In Colombia, the new Government has expressed its commitment to implementing the peace agreement with the Fuerza Alternativa Revolucionaria del Comun and initiating formal negotiations with the Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional (ELN) guerrilla group. The ELN also seems inclined to renew dialogue. As a guarantor country, Norway remains committed to Colombia’s quest for peace and to supporting the parties in that endeavour.
In all the peace processes in which Norway is engaged, we promote active involvement and participation by women in line with the women and peace and security agenda. We talk to all parties as we work to achieve peaceful conflict resolution. Without dialogue, we have no opportunity to influence the parties and encourage them to move in a more positive direction.
Norway also strongly supports the good offices of the Secretary-General in conflicts worldwide. We commend him and his dedicated team for their important work on the Black Sea Grain Initiative, and Tiirkiye for its important contribution. The prices of food, fuel and fertilizer were already high before the war in Ukraine, but the war has dramatically exacerbated the situation. If the global community does not act swiftly, the current food price crisis will develop into a food availability and food supply crisis — and that is too serious to ignore.
Together with fighting climate change, Norway has placed food security at the top of its development agenda. This year we are allocating more than $300 million in funding to food security initiatives alone. We need to increase humanitarian assistance and enhance social safety nets, promote local food production in the global South, secure access to seeds, fertilizers and technology for small-scale farmers and accelerate the transformation to climate-resilient and sustainable food systems. In doing all of that, we must ensure that the needs of women and girls are adequately integrated.
We are all dependent on a collective response if we are to succeed in addressing climate change and the loss of biodiversity. We are currently not on track, and that needs to change. Norway will honour its commitment to cut greenhouse-gas emissions and play a key role in the green transition. We have listened to the concerns of developing countries and have decided to double our climate financing to those countries by 2026. Within that target, we aim to at least triple our funding for climate adaptation and resilience.
Climate change affects millions of people worldwide and increases the needs of vulnerable people. However, the current humanitarian system will not be able to meet the increasing humanitarian needs. As global warming continues, weather and climate extremes will increasingly have an impact on armed conflict. Climate and security are already closely interlinked. The fight against climate change requires new, innovative approaches, and we must do what we can to ensure the success of the upcoming twenty- seventh Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Egypt. Norway will not rest between now and then.
The Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet brings together private and public resources with the objective of accelerating development. As co-Chair, Norway will work with partners across the global South to support the initiation of renewable energy transitions, reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, increase clean power and create green jobs.
Given our geography and our history, the oceans can — and will — be a vital part of the solution to climate change, food insecurity and poverty. If adequately managed and protected, the oceans hold the key to achieving many of the Sustainable Development Goals. Yet Sustainable Development Goal 14 is the most underfunded, which is why Norway is pushing for change.
The High-level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, which is co-chaired by Norway, is an initiative by world leaders committed to ocean health and ocean wealth, in support of the 2030 Agenda. Panel members have committed to sustainably manage 100 per cent of the ocean areas under their national jurisdiction. We will establish sustainable ocean plans and urge other coastal States to do the same.
The fifth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly was an important breakthrough for multilateral cooperation on environmental issues. Norway will work to ensure an effective agreement on combating plastic pollution through a life-cycle approach.
We must not overlook existing crises as new ones emerge. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is not over yet; we cannot go from COVID-19 panic to COVID-19 neglect. We must use the lessons learned from the pandemic and the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator. That will be key to preventing, preparing for and responding to new outbreaks of infectious disease.
Russia’s unlawful act of aggression against Ukraine has heightened geopolitical tensions and presented obstacles to multilateral cooperation. That is serious. As a Security Council member, Norway has consistently sought to strengthen the Council’s mandate to maintain international peace and security. Despite increased geopolitical tensions, the Security Council has retained its ability to adopt important resolutions. We secured a robust mandate for the United Nations in Afghanistan. Together with the Niger, we negotiated a groundbreaking resolution on the protection of education in armed conflict (Security Council resolution 2601 (2021)), and we partnered with Ghana on a resolution on maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea (Security Council resolution 2634 (2022)). All that matters.
In times of crisis and rising global tensions, we all feel the pressure to put domestic concerns before global solidarity. In times of distress, it is only natural for political leaders to try to look after their own populations; it is their responsibility. But let us remind ourselves that there is no contradiction between that and engaging with the rest of the world — quite the contrary, it is in the interests of our citizens. We are bound together, we are dependent on each other and we have a shared destiny.
It is clear to me that, without a strong and effective United Nations, the international community will not be able to address the challenges it faces. That is why we applaud and support the Secretary-General’s report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982). If anything, it is even more urgent to implement that report now than when it was launched. The Summit of the Future, to be held in September 2024, will be an important milestone. We expect, and will work towards, an ambitious declaration on future generations, and we look forward to engaging with the High-level Advisory Board and Member States in the process ahead.
We are living in challenging times, but let us never lose hope. We must face the current challenges with resolve and recall the strength that we can muster when we act together."
Pakistan,PAK,Asia,"  212,228,000 ",5250,4.044000149,5.5,67.114,Cardiovascular Disease,Neonatal Disorder,Neoplasm,19331,9.11,"  159,976,813 ",75.38,5.08,"As I stand here today to tell the story of my country, Pakistan, my heart and mind have not been able to leave home. Standing here, I still feel as though I am visiting one of the flood-affected areas of Sindh and Balochistan in my country. No words can describe the shock that we are living through or how the face of the country lies transformed. I have come to explain first-hand the scale and magnitude of that climate catastrophe that has pushed one third of my country under water in a superstorm of a scale that that no one has seen in living memory. For 40 days and 40 nights, a biblical flood poured down on us, smashing centuries of weather records and challenging everything we knew about disaster and how to manage it.
Even today, huge swathes of the country are still underwater, submerged in an ocean of human suffering. In that ground-zero of climate change, 33 million people, including women and children, are now at high risk from health hazards, with 650,000 women giving birth underneath makeshift tarpaulins. More than 1,500 of my people have left the world in the great flood, including more than 400 children. Far more are in peril from disease and malnutrition. As we speak, millions of climate migrants are still looking for dry land on which to pitch their tents, with heart-breaking losses to their families, futures and livelihoods, gone for a long time to come.
Early estimates suggest that more than 13,000 kilometres of metalled roads have been damaged; more than 370 bridges have been swept away; 1 million homes have been destroyed; and another million damaged. More than 1 million farm animals have been killed; 4 million acres of crops have been washed away, stripping the people of their source of food and resulting in damage of an unimaginable scale.
Pakistan has never seen a starker and devastating example of the impact of global warming. Life in Pakistan has changed forever. I have visited and spent time in every corner of my devastated country. People in Pakistan ask why has this happened to them? When global warming rips apart whole families and an entire country at such ferocious speed, it is time to ask, “Why?” And it is time to ask not what can be done, but what must be done. The undeniable truth is that the calamity has not been triggered by anything we have done. Our glaciers are melting fast, our forests are burning and our heat waves have surpassed the 53°C mark, making us the hottest place on the planet.
And now we are living through an unprecedented monster monsoon. It is literally a monsoon on steroids, as the Secretary-General described it most befittingly. It is on steroids. One thing is very clear: What happened in Pakistan will not remain in Pakistan. As the Secretary- General has so candidly said, hotspots like Pakistan fall in the 10 most climate-vulnerable list of countries, but emit less than 1 per cent of the greenhouse gases that are burning our planet. It is therefore entirely reasonable to expect some approximation of justice for the loss and damage, not to mention building back better with resilience and strength. Clearly, the time for talk about taking action has passed.
At this point, I am profoundly grateful that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres visited Pakistan, where he spent time with climate refugees and mothers and children in tents and repeatedly assured us of his support and assistance. At this point, I want to thank each and every one of the countries that have sent help to Pakistan and their representatives to Pakistan for standing in solidarity with us at our most trying hour. On behalf of my nation, I once again express my sincerest appreciation to all of them.
The impacts on the health and wealth of my country are beyond calculation at this point. My real worry therefore is about the next stage of the challenge. When the cameras are gone and have left the Assembly and the story just shifts away to conflicts like that in Ukraine, my question is, will we be left alone, high and dry, to cope with a crisis that we did not create and is not of our doing? Where and how do we begin to rehabilitate and reconstruct after the rescue and relief effort that is still ongoing after 12 long weeks? For many of the lives we have saved, the future is dimmed by new fragility, lost homes, decimated livelihoods, deluged crop-lands, permanent food insecurity and exposure to uncertain futures. Approximately 11 million people will be pushed further below the poverty line, while others will drift to cramped urban shelters, leaving little room for climate-smart rebuilding.
For now, we have mobilized all available resources in our domain, squeezing resources from left and right, for the national relief effort, and have repurposed all budget priorities, including development funds, to the rescue and first-order needs of millions. Cash transfers to the most affected — 4 million women heads of household — began weeks ago via our social security programme, the Benazir Income Support Programme, which was established in the name of former late Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Her son is our Foreign Minister today. We are spending 70 billion rupees, or almost $300 million, out of our own pockets on the Programme, but, at this point, the gap between our urgent needs and available resources is increasing by the day and is amplified by the sheer, unprecedented scale of the disaster. Our manpower and resources are totally overstretched.
The question that should be raised here is quite simple: Why are my people paying the price of such a high level of global warming through no fault of their own? We have not contributed to that. Nature has unleashed her fury on Pakistan without looking at our carbon footprint, which is next to nothing. Our actions did not contribute to that. The dual costs of global inaction and climate injustice are having a crippling effect on both our treasury and people, right now and over there.
This is going to be a long haul, and, in these most trying circumstances, hope is the best enemy of darkness. Pakistanis are known to be exceptionally resilient people. For my part, I am fully committed and geared to fighting the battle for our survival in the tents and trenches with my people until we have rebuilt Pakistan to face the growing challenges of this century. It is high time we took a pause from the preoccupations of the twentieth century to return to the challenges of the twenty-first century. The entire definition of national security has changed today, and, unless the leaders of the world come together to act now, based on an agreed common agenda, there will be no Earth to fight wars over. Nature will be fighting back, and for that humankind is no match at all.
Pakistan’s urgent priority right now is to ensure rapid economic growth and lift millions of people out of poverty and hunger. In order to enable any such policy momentum, Pakistan needs a stable external environment. We look for peace with all our neighbours, including India. Sustainable peace and stability in South Asia, however, remains contingent upon a just and lasting solution to the Jammu and Kashmir dispute. At the heart of that long-standing dispute lies the denial of the inalienable right of the Kashmiri people to self- determination.
India’s illegal and unilateral actions of 5 August 2019 to change the internationally recognized disputed status of Jammu and Kashmir and to alter the demographic structure of the occupied territory further undermined the prospects for peace and inflamed regional tensions.
India’s ruthless campaign of repression against Kashmiris has continued to grow in scale and intensity. In pursuit of that heinous goal, New Delhi has ramped up its military deployments in occupied Jammu and Kashmir to 900,000 troops, thereby making it the most militarized zone in the world. The serial brutalization of Kashmiris has taken many forms— extrajudicial killings, incarceration, custodial torture and death, indiscriminate use of force, deliberate targeting of Kashmiri youth with pellet guns and collective punishments imposed on entire communities.
In a classic settler-colonial project, India is seeking to turn Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir into a Hindu territory, through illegal demographic changes. Millions of fake domicile certificates have been issued to non-Kashmiris. Kashmiri land and properties are being seized. Electoral districts have been gerrymandered, and more than 2.5 million non-Kashmiri illegal voters have fraudulently registered. All this is in blatant violation of the relevant Security Council resolutions and international law, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention.
For our part, the Pakistani people have always stood by our Kashmiri brothers and sisters in complete solidarity and will continue to do so until, no matter what, their right to self-determination is fully realized in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions. I assure the world from this rostrum that we in Pakistan remain consistent in our commitment to peace in South Asia. India must take credible steps to create an enabling environment for constructive engagement. We are neighbours, and we will be there forever. The choice is ours whether we live in peace or continue fighting with one another. Since 1947, we have had three wars, and, as a consequence, only misery, poverty and unemployment have increased on both sides.
It is now up to us to resolve our differences, problems and issues as peaceful neighbours through peaceful negotiations and discussions and save our scarce resources for promoting education, health and employment for millions of people, including young boys and girls, on both sides of the divide, not vesting them in buying more ammunition and promoting tension in the area. I believe that it is high time that India understood the message loud and clear that both countries are armed to the teeth. War is not an option. It is not an option. Only peaceful dialogue can resolve the issues so that world will become more peaceful in the future.
Afghanistan today presents a unique challenge; 30 million Afghans have been left without a functional economy or banking system allowing ordinary Afghans to make a living to build a better future. Pakistan would also like to see an Afghanistan that is at peace with itself and the world and that respects and nurtures all its citizens, without regard to gender, ethnicity or religion. Pakistan is working to encourage respect for the rights of Afghan girls and women to education and work. Yet, at this point, isolating the Afghan interim Government could exacerbate the suffering of the Afghan people, who are already destitute. Constructive engagement and economic support are more likely to secure a positive response.
A peaceful, prosperous and connected Afghanistan is in our collective interests. As a neighbour, Pakistan has a vital stake in peace and stability in Afghanistan. We have led the humanitarian efforts to help our Afghan brothers and sisters. We must avoid another civil war, a rise in terrorism, drug trafficking and a new wave of refugees, whom none of Afghanistan’s neighbours is in a position to accommodate. Pakistan urges the international community to respond positively to the Secretary-General’s appeal for $4.2 billion in humanitarian and economic assistance to Afghanistan and release Afghanistan’s financial reserves, which are essential to reviving its banking system.
Pakistan shares the key concern of the international community with regard to the threat posed by the major terrorist groups operating out of Afghanistan, especially the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan Province, the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan, Al-Qaida, the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. They all need to be dealt with effectively and comprehensively, with the support and cooperation of the interim Afghan authorities. In turn, the international community should address Afghanistan’s dire humanitarian needs.
Pakistan strongly condemns terrorism in all its forms, shades and manifestations. Terrorism does not have a religion. It is based on dogma, fuelled by poverty, unemployment, deprivation, injustice and ignorance and fanned by vested interests. Pakistan is the principal victim of terrorism. Over the past two decades, we have suffered more than 80,000 casualties and more than $150 billion in economic losses, owing to terrorist attacks. Our armed forces, with the support of our people — mothers, traders, students, teachers, engineers and doctors — have broken the back of terrorism within Pakistan. Yet we continue to suffer from terrorist attacks from across our borders, sponsored and financed by our regional adversary. We are determined to defeat such cross-border terrorism.
I must say loud and clear that the number of sacrifices that Pakistan has made to defeat terrorism over that period of time has been unprecedented in its contemporary history. I tell my friends often that if they see a mother or a child limping on the streets of Pakistan, maybe they were the victims of terrorists years ago. That is the kind of sacrifice that Pakistan has made. Our generals, soldiers, doctors, mothers, teachers, students and traders all paid with their lives for Pakistan’s wellbeing and defeated terrorism. And the peace that was restored in Pakistan, after great sacrifice, is not only for Pakistan; it is a peace for countries throughout the world and the global community. We are very proud of it. That is the greatest manifestation of our commitment, concern and continued efforts to defeat terrorism wherever it may be.
Islamophobia is a global phenomenon. Since 9/11, suspicion and fear of Muslims and discrimination against them have escalated to epidemic proportions. The officially sponsored campaign of oppression against India’s more than 200 million Muslims is the worst manifestation of Islamophobia. They are subjected to discriminatory laws and policies, hijab bans, attacks on mosques and lynchings by Hindu mobs. I am particularly concerned about the calls for genocide against India’s Muslims by some extremist groups.
Earlier this year, the General Assembly adopted landmark resolution 76/254, introduced by Pakistan on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, designating 15 March as the International Day to Combat Islamophobia. It is my sincere and ardent hope that that will lead to concrete measures by the United Nations and Member States to combat Islamophobia and promote interfaith harmony.
Pakistan is deeply concerned about the numerous conflicts across the Middle East, including in Syria and Yemen. We support all possible efforts to promote their peaceful resolution. We call on Israel to end immediately the blatant use of force against the Palestinian people, the flagrant violations of their human rights and the repeated desecration of the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque. The only just, comprehensive and lasting solution to the Palestinian question is the acceptance of a viable, independent and contiguous Palestinian State, within the pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.
The Security Council and the General Assembly must be empowered to play their respective roles under the Charter of the United Nations. The Security Council must be expanded by adding 11 new non-permanent members to make it more representative, democratic, transparent, effective and accountable. Adding new permanent members will paralyse the Council’s decision-making, enlarge its representational deficit and create new centres of privilege in violation of the principle of sovereign equality of Member States.
The nations of the world must step back from the precipice. We must restore peace in Europe, avoid a war in Asia and resolve festering conflicts across the world. We must revive the vision that created the United Nations, which is often blurred by national interests and hegemonic designs. Pakistan is a partner for peace.
But peace can be ensured and guaranteed only when the rights of communities that have been suffering and subjugated for decades get and earn their freedom and are respected.
In that regard, before concluding, I will once again say, at the cost of repeating myself, that we want peace with India, but long-lasting, enduring peace can be ensured and guaranteed only through a just and fair solution to the issue of Kashmir, providing rights, including the right to self-determination, to the people of Kashmir in accordance with the Charter and the relevant Security Council resolutions. And I will be most forthcoming and ready to sit down and talk to our Indian counterpart to pave the way forward for the future so that our future generations will not suffer and we spend our resources on mitigating misery and building infrastructure to face those threats and outbursts of clouds.
We are developing societies. We do not have unlimited resources. We must deploy our resources for the people’s well-being, our children and their development, empowerment, employment, health and education. Of course, other developing societies must find their own place within the community of nations through hard work, untiring efforts and sacrifice. That is the only way forward. Therefore, we will work with all those committed to the principles of the Charter to restore the vision that created the United Nations and to equip the Organization with the capacity to preserve global peace and promote universal prosperity."
Palestine,PSE,Asia,"  4,863,000 ",2762,27.39999962,4.6,73.895,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Neonatal Disorder,,0.00,"  4,863,000 ",100.00,8.05,"I am addressing the General Assembly today on behalf of the more than 14 million Palestinians whose parents and ancestors lived through the tragic Nakba 74 years ago and who are still experiencing its consequences, a source of shame for humankind and especially for all who conspired, planned and executed that heinous crime. More than 5 million Palestinians have been living under Israel’s military occupation for 54 years. I want to tell the Assembly today, on behalf of the Palestinians to whom I proudly belong, that unfortunately our trust in the possibility of achieving peace based on justice and international law is deteriorating because of Israel’s occupation policies. Does the international community want to smother whatever hope we have left?
It is clear that Israel, which is ignoring all the resolutions of international legitimacy, has decided not to be our partner in the peace process. It has undermined the Oslo Accords, which it signed with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Through its current policies, which are premeditated and deliberate, it has destroyed the possibility of a two-State solution, and that is unequivocal proof that Israel does not believe in
peace. It believes in imposing the status quo by brute force and aggression. We therefore do not have an Israeli partner with whom we can talk. Israel is ending its contractual relation with us and is making the relationship between the State of Palestine and Israel into no more than one between an occupying State and an occupied people. We will therefore deal with Israel as such henceforward, and we call on the international community to do the same. It was not we who made that choice but rather Israel on its own.
Israel is launching a frantic campaign to confiscate our lands, build colonial settlements and loot our resources, as if the land was unpopulated and had no owners, just as in 1948. It is giving free rein to the army and the terrorist settlers who are killing our Palestinian people in broad daylight, looting their land and taking their water, burning and demolishing their homes and forcing them to pay for the demolition or to destroy their homes with their own hands and uproot their own trees. All of that is done with official protection. Can anyone imagine such a thing? Israel is telling the Palestinian people, “Either you demolish your house or I will demolish it myself. But it is better if you demolish your house yourself with your own hands, because if I demolish it, you will have to pay for the demolition.” Can anyone conceive of that? I have to demolish my house or Israel will demolish it and make me pay for it.
The Israeli Government has authorized the establishment of racist Jewish terrorist organizations committing acts of terror against our people. It has provided them with protection while they subject Palestinians to aggression and call for them to be expelled from their homes. Foremost among those terrorist organizations are Hilltop Youth, Price Tag, Lehava, the Temple Guardians and many others. Those terrorist organizations are led by members of the Israeli Knesset, the Israeli authority. In that context, we call on the international community to put those organizations on the international terrorist lists. That is the only place they deserve to be.
In its frantic settlement expansion, Israel has not left us any land on which we can establish our independent State. Where can our people live in freedom and dignity? Where can we build our independent State to live in peace with our neighbours? We want to live in peace with them, with Israel. Where will we establish our independent State to live in peace with them, with Israel? Unfortunately there are now nearly 750,000 settlers, or 25 per cent of the total population, in the West Bank, the remaining Palestinian land after the partition resolution.
Israel is killing our people with impunity, as it did with the Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. Everyone here has heard about Shireen Abu Akleh. She was killed with a sniper’s bullets, which means that the sniper targeted her deliberately. Israel has admitted that a sniper killed her. In addition to being Palestinian, she also had American nationality. I dare the United States to prosecute or make accountable those who killed her, because they are Israelis.
Israel also commits acts of aggression against our sacred holy sites, both Christian and Islamic, especially in Jerusalem, our eternal capital and crown jewel. I would like to reiterate in that regard our acknowledgement of the Hashemite Custodianship of those holy sites. Israel attacks Muslim and Christian holy sites on a daily basis and without any reason. Israel attacked the funeral procession of Shireen Abu Akleh and her corpse inside the church, a holy place. That is what Israel is doing to the holy sites.
Israel is imposing falsified curriculums in our schools in the occupied Jerusalem. They are inventing curriculums. They take books and change what is in them under the same authors and then they impose the curriculums on our children to control what they learn. We will not allow that to happen. That is a violation of international law.
Israel is disrupting the Palestinian presidential and legislative elections by forbidding Palestinian citizens in Jerusalem to take part in those elections. Israel has done that three times before — in 1996, 2005 and 2006. The Israeli authorities ask us, “Why do you not organize elections?” We are ready. We issued the decrees to organize those elections, and we decided to hold them, but Israel prevented us from holding them. Therefore, we did not cancel the elections, we only postponed them. When Israel allows the elections to take place, or when some party tells Israel that it can allow us to hold elections, or when orders reach Israel to allow elections to take place, we will then organize them.
Israel is enacting racist laws and consecrating the apartheid regime. Yes, it is apartheid. Even if Israel does not like that appellation, it is apartheid. Israel is an apartheid regime. This is not only between Palestinians and Jews. Israel is taking actions against our people before the eyes of the international community with impunity. Why is Israel not being held accountable
for violating international law? Who is protecting Israel from being held accountable? I have no idea. Do Member States know who is protecting Israel from being held accountable? It is the United Nations, and foremost of which the most powerful in the United Nations. Why practise double standards when it comes to Israel?
Israel has repeatedly violated our land, and recently it closed the headquarters of six Palestinian human rights organizations. Israel tries to implement the law, but if we make a mistake, it holds us accountable and says, “You have made a mistake.” Israel determined, suddenly, that those organizations were terrorist organizations, and it raided their headquarters, looted their assets, confiscated their documents and burned them and did whatever it wanted. The whole world says that was wrong, except for Israel. Israel is saying that it was not wrong. If that is what Israel did to the offices of human rights organizations, imagine what it would have done if they were not human rights organizations.
Since its creation, Israel has committed brutal crimes against our people. It destroyed 529 Palestinian villages and expelled their residents during and after the war of 1948. It displaced 950,000 Palestinian refugees, in other words, half of the Palestinian population at the time. That is a figure that some try to manipulate. It is not, as Israel says, 250,000 refugees. No, the figure is indeed 950,000, according to the statistics of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, that is, the United Nations. And of course, now the number of displaced is in the millions.
Since 1948, Israel has committed more than 50 massacres, including in Tantoura and Kafr Qasim. Israel admitted that it had deliberately committed those massacres and targeted farmers returning from their farmland and killed them in cold blood. There have been 50 or 51 massacres, the most recent of which was against Gaza, which was targeted with missiles. I will not tell the Assembly how many elderly persons it killed, but The New York Times, a United States newspaper, said 67 children were killed in Gaza, as if they had been carrying rockets, using tanks and launching missiles. Sixty-seven children were killed by Israel. These are their photos. Who is going to assume responsibility for that? Why did Israel kill them?
I would like to provide the Assembly with the lists of the villages that were destroyed and the massacres that were perpetrated, and I would ask Israel, from this rostrum, to acknowledge its responsibility for destroying those villages, committing those massacres and displacing the Palestinian citizens and to apologize to the Palestinian people. After all that killing, Israel must apologize.
We call on Israel to bear the legal, political, moral and material responsibilities. It should be held accountable, and the international community must hold it accountable. We ask the international community right now to hold Israel accountable for the massacres it has committed.
Yes, we will go to the International Criminal Court, and to all the courts of the world, but first and foremost to the International Criminal Court to ask Israel to assume its legal, political, moral and material responsibilities.
Do the Israeli people want to remain colonizers forever? They have been colonizers for nearly 75 years. How much longer do they want to remain so? I ask the Assembly, should we wait for a century, or maybe for two centuries? Why are we the only people on this planet still living under occupation? I ask the General Assembly, the Security Council and advocates of human rights, why should we remain under occupation?
What are we still missing? What are the Israelis going to teach us? What are we missing that they need to occupy us, teach us, kill us, slaughter us or confiscate our land and loot our resources? They even take the rain that falls on us, and then they sell it back to us. They take our rain, and they sell it back to us.
We do not accept remaining the only party to respect the agreements we signed with Israel in 1993. Those agreements are no longer valid on the ground because of Israel’s persistence on violating them. Although we have asked Israel to end its occupation, its hostile measures and policies and unilateral actions, which were explicitly prohibited in the Oslo Accords and which President Biden mentioned to me personally — he said that unilateral actions should be ended — and while the Oslo Accords state that they should be ended, Israel has been the first to violate this prohibition, taking nothing but unilateral actions, while we have not taken any. We do not want to do that, and we do not want to violate agreements. Until when will we be the only ones committed to these agreements?
It is therefore our right — or, rather, our obligation — to look for other means to recover our rights and achieve a peace built on justice, including the implementation of the resolutions that were adopted
by our respective leaders, in particular our parliaments. Seven years ago, our parliament adopted decisions, and we told its members to wait awhile, since maybe things will change; we told them to be patient, since maybe the United States or Israel will change its stance. But no one listened to us.
We have made these decisions in order to preserve our national existence on our land and to uphold our historical rights as a nation under the umbrella of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), the only legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. The PLO brings together all Palestinian people, wherever they are in the world, be it inside Palestine, in the refugee camps or in the diaspora. All those who have Palestinian nationality or used to have the Palestinian nationality fall under the umbrella of the PLO.
The United Nations, with its different bodies, has adopted hundreds of resolutions on Palestine. None has been implemented. How is that possible? Not a single resolution has been implemented. I am talking about 754 General Assembly resolutions, 97 Security Council resolutions and 96 Human Rights Council resolutions — and not a single one has been implemented.
How come? Why is that? Whenever a resolution is adopted, everyone calls for its implementation in line with international legitimacy, but no one cares about any of the resolutions adopted for Palestine. Not a single resolution has been implemented.
We ask that one single resolution be implemented, so we can know that it has been implemented. We now want the implementation of a single resolution, resolution 181 (II), which was adopted by the General Assembly, and which unjustly and aggressively partitioned Palestine. Yes, we want that resolution to be implemented. We want the General Assembly to implement resolution 181 (II), and with it, another resolution, namely, resolution 194 (III). We want those two resolutions to be implemented because they are preconditions for Israel being accepted as a member of the United Nations. When those resolutions were adopted, Moshe Sharett, the Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time, pledged to implement them, and as a result, Israel was accepted as member of the United Nations. But until now neither resolution has been implemented. I want resolution 181 (II) to be implemented — one single resolution. It is our right to ask for its implementation.
I therefore ask that the General Assembly implement resolution 181 (II) and tell us that it has done so. We have submitted a request to the Secretary- General to implement that resolution. Is that possible or the Assembly will ignore us once again, as always?
The State of Palestine will also start the process of acceding to other international organizations. We were allowed to join the United Nations as an observer State. We are now an observer State at the United Nations. There are 15 million Palestinians, all of them educated, some of them highly educated, but we are only observer member.
That membership status allows us to accede to other international organizations, and starting tomorrow we will pursue our right and accede to them. It is our right to do so. We will join the World Health Organization, the World Intellectual Property Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization. We are going to accede to those organizations, which is our right to do, and no one should blame us.
The Security Council has adopted clear resolutions, whose implementation would achieve a just and comprehensive peace. The most recent of those was resolution 2334 (2016), which the United States itself submitted for adoption. The resolution was adopted, and two days after taking office Mr. Trump cancelled everything, including resolution 2334 (2016), and subsequently came up with his ultimate deal, which, together with all his other projects, we have totally rejected. Resolution 2334 (2016) was submitted by the United States and adopted under its sponsorship. But it went away because Mr. Trump rejected it.
I would like to remind the Assembly that we no longer need double standards. If the State of Palestine is prohibited from obtaining full membership at the United Nations and if the Palestinian people are not protected from aggression — but no one has done anything — and if practical steps are not taken to end occupation and achieve peace, then we will have to resort once again to petitioning the General Assembly, asking for legal measures and political steps to be taken to achieve those goals. Then we will have hope. We have the right to hope. We hope to be able to hope. We are living on hope. We are confident that the General Assembly will fully shoulder its responsibilities.
I am also confident that the Assembly will understand why we are going to take all those steps now. Throughout the years we have tried everything to
convince Israel to return to the negotiating table based on the resolutions of international legitimacy and the signed agreements, but Israel has refused and continues to refuse to do so.
With all due respect to what the international community has done — or has at least tried to do, because it has not done everything — in terms of support to our people and our just question politically and materially, it has unfortunately been unable to end the Israeli occupation and the heinous and continuous Israeli aggression against our people and provide them with protection. We want to be protected. We ask that we be protected. Protect us.
We will not resort to weapons. We will not resort to violence. That I can promise. We will not resort to terrorism. Working hand in hand with members of the General Assembly, we will fight terrorism, but we want to be protected from violence, terrorism and arms just like other peoples of the world.
The occupying State is acting as if it were a State above the law. Why is Israel acting as if it were a State above the law? Can anyone answer me? No one will answer me.
Surprisingly, States like the United States of America claim that they uphold international law and human rights, while at the same time — and I will speak frankly in this context — they provide unlimited support to Israel, and protect Israel from accountability. Those States assist Israel in pursuing its hostile policies, in contempt of the international community as a whole. Israel would not have been able to do what it is doing without the cover or the support of those States. Honestly put, even if members do not say that out of courtesy, I will say it.
Some of those States were partners at the very beginning, when they adopted decisions that led to the Nakba of the Palestinian people, in particular the ominous Balfour Declaration. Do members of the Assembly remember the Balfour Declaration? Of course they do not, because we are the only ones who are suffering its consequences. And then came the mandate and the sustained injustice against the Palestinian people when those States refused to compel Israel to end its occupation and aggression and respect the resolutions of international legitimacy. Those States therefore bear, along with Israel, the responsibility for the plight of the Palestinian people.
We therefore request Britain, the United States and Israel — and this is an official request — to acknowledge their responsibility for the major crime that was committed against our people and apologize for it. We ask for remedy and redress and for compensation to be granted to the Palestinian people — compensation that would be decided under international law. We will accept whatever is decided. We just want the injustice to be acknowledged.
Sadly enough, the United States and several European States that are enthusiastic about the two- State solution have recognized the State of Israel but have not so far recognized the State of Palestine. Our State exists and should be recognized in order to achieve peace. Those States have not so far recognized the State of Palestine, and they threaten to use the veto right if we try to ask for a full membership at the United Nations. If we ask — or when we ask — for full membership, they threaten us with the use of the veto right. To whom can we complain? We can only complain to God.
For 10 years now, the Observer State of Palestine at the United Nations has proved that Palestine qualifies for full membership. We have all recognized this. Palestine has been working seriously and responsibly with other States of the world in different committees and specialized organs. It has successfully and with great efficiency chaired the Group of 77 and China. We are an observer State, and yet we have chaired that Group and succeeded in our work, and the Assembly has recognized that. So why we are not allowed to be a full member? What are we lacking? Why is it that those States cannot recognize the State of Palestine and accept its full-fledged membership in the United Nations?
We therefore wish, beg and plead as we reiterate our request to attain full membership now. We also ask why double standards are imposed upon us? We are the exception. We are the only ones in the world on whom double standards are being imposed.
On the other hand, we call upon the Secretary- General of the United Nations to work tirelessly to come up with an international plan to end the occupation of the land of the State of Palestine, to achieve peace, security and stability in the region, in line with the resolutions of the international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative. The Arab Peace Initiative has been violated by some, but it still exists, and resolution 1515 (2003) still needs to be implemented.
When we hear something positive, we acknowledge it. Yesterday and the day before, I listened to President of the United States Joe Biden and the Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid (see A/77/PV. 6 and A/77/PV.8, respectively), and to other world leaders. I heard them supporting the two-State solution, and I was pleased to hear that. Undoubtedly, this is a positive development.
The real test for the seriousness and credibility of this stance — because we have had enough of resolutions and words — is for the Israeli Government to return to the negotiating table immediately, tomorrow, to implement the two-State solution in line with the relevant resolutions of international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative, and to end all the unilateral measures that undermine the two-State solution.
Israel cannot negotiate while building settlements, killing and injuring people, and demolishing houses. On the contrary, those acts must cease even temporarily to let us negotiate. If the negotiations fail, then Israel can do whatever it wants. But if it wants to negotiate, it has to stop these unilateral measures.
In reality, the State of Palestine is looking forward to peace. Let us make peace so that we can live in security, stability and prosperity for the benefit of future generations of all the peoples of the region.
We want peace. We are fighting terrorism wherever it is found. The Assembly knows that we have signed agreements to fight global terrorism with 85 States around the world, at the forefront of which is the United States. No one can deny it. What more is required from us? We are ready for that.
I want to tell my people and the whole world that I am proud to have spent many decades of my life struggling with my brethren, the leaders of the Palestinian people, some who have passed away and some who are still alive, to preserve the rights of our heroes and courageous people, which have been the best example of sacrifice. Despite all the conspiracies and pressures that were placed on our people, we have maintained our independent national decision, which is a decision with which no one can interfere. The decisions we take are our own, and no one can interfere in them.
We are also attached to our national constants, which are well known, and we reiterate our rejection of any order or directive from whomever in the world. We are not ready to accept directives from any State, whether large or small. We make our own decisions.
I would like to pay tribute to the Palestinian martyrs who have lit the way to freedom and independence with their blood. They will remain symbols to be remembered by generations of Palestinians one after the other with gratitude and reverence, and we will live up to the responsibility they left us.
As for our brave prisoners, they are the living conscience of our people. They are sacrificing their freedom for the freedom of their people. Words cannot describe them. They are living martyrs. Some have received four or five life sentences, keeping them endlessly in prisons. They are heroes and deep-rooted leaders. We will always work for their freedom. We will not fail them until they are freed. We will not fail their sons and their daughters. We will not fail their families and their relatives.
Some of our prisoners are children — of 10 years of age, 8 years of age, 7 years of age, 6 years of age — yet they are prisoners. We have one child who was arrested by 30 soldiers. Is it acceptable? Tens of thousands of our children are in prison. Who can accept that? Which international law — which good conscience — can accept that a seven-year-old child is prosecuted and imprisoned? Legally and practically speaking, children are not responsible for all their acts.
I would like to talk about the hero and prisoner Nasser Abu Hamid whose transformation since he was sentenced is shocking. Look at how he was before and how he is now. Now, he is just waiting for his death to come at any time. His mother is asking to see him for just one minute. Why are they not allowing his mother to see him for a single minute? She is the mother of martyrs and prisoners. The mother of Nasser Abu Hamid has numerous children, and among them are martyrs and prisoners. She wants to see her son, but she is forbidden to see him. No religion, no law can find this acceptable.
From this rostrum, I would like to pay tribute to the mother of Nasser, a mother of prisoners and martyrs. Unfortunately, the occupying Power has not allowed her to see her son, the prisoner and hero, for a single minute while he is fighting death because of medical negligence. He is a prisoner with cancer. He committed a crime but, from a humanitarian point of view, he should be receive treatment but he is not allowed to. He is not allowed to see his mother, and no one will be allowed to see him, even after he passes away. We have hundreds of graves with numbers. They put deceased martyrs in a digital prison to punish his mother — and
us. Since 1967, martyrs are held in digital prisons and mortuaries. Is this acceptable? Who can accept that?
In conclusion, I would like to say to the General Assembly, which represents the international community and embodies international legitimacy, that the occupation will definitely end, sooner or later. Let the Assembly now bear the responsibility for implementing its resolutions. Let us achieve a just and comprehensive peace instead of achieving a peace with further sacrifices.
We have been waiting for too long. We are very tired. We have had to live through long bitter days. Does the General Assembly have a solution? I want a solution."

I would like to convey to the General Assembly the greetings of His Excellency Mr. Laurentino Cortizo Cohen, President of the Republic of Panama, who has delegated me to represent our country here today.
Our country firmly supports the important themes proposed for consideration at this session of the General Assembly. We share the view that, in order to overcome the global health crisis and move forward in the transition to a post-pandemic world, we must promote creative solutions and share a greater degree of solidarity and support, using science as a fundamental ally to confront the challenges facing humankind. Knowledge, research and education are the tools required to ensure that transition, especially in nations with high levels of poverty, where millions continue to be deprived of the opportunity to live a dignified life. Too many people continue to starve; meanwhile, others suffer from indigestion. Withholding knowledge instead of sharing it is a selfish act.
The current Government of the Republic of Panama has been at the helm of the country for 38 months, 30 of them during the pandemic. No other Administration in the history of Panama has been confronted with such complex challenges. In that regard, we concentrated our efforts on saving lives, preventing the collapse of the health system and maintaining social peace. Two and a half years later, we are on the threshold of recovering from the damage caused by the global health crisis, and we continue to make progress. We are capable of achieving exceptional outcomes that we can share with the world.
Our national strategic plan was conceived with a particular objective in mind: fighting the causes of poverty and inequality. Our Government’s leadership rests on our commitment to laying the foundations for profound transformations. While our country is indeed experiencing robust growth, it also faces unacceptable inequality, and we are working tenaciously and tirelessly to combat that reality. Our Administration seeks to lay the foundations for a fairer country, consolidate democracy and strengthen the independence of the judiciary. For the first time in the history of our country, as Head of the Government, the President waived his prerogative to unilaterally appoint the judges of the Supreme Court of Justice and established a system of independent evaluation based on professional merit. Also for the first time in the history of our country, the majority of the judges on the Supreme Court of Justice are women, and none of them has any relationship, link or subordination to the President of the Republic.
In Panama as in the rest of the world, we had to face the pandemic. Protecting human lives, especially those of the most vulnerable, was our primary mission. We deployed creativity and innovation to develop technological instruments that enabled us to serve our population directly, openly and equitably. We transformed Panama’s national identity card into an instrument for transferring resources — a free debit card, in fact.
We were the first country on the continent to implement a centralized tracing and monitoring system for communicable diseases, which registers every case
of infection in real time in our national epidemiological surveillance system.
We stopped students’ learning processes from being disrupted during the lockdown period by using the strategy for resilient educational transformation computer platform, known as ESTER. We guarantee free internet access to the vast majority of students, including those in remote communities.
We are currently overseeing the development of the MedicApp platform, an innovative digital database that keeps citizens informed in real time about the availability of medicines, as well as points of sale and comparative prices. We are willing to share those experiences and achievements — which have been recognized by international organizations, including the United Nations — with the international community.
I fully share with our President Cortizo the belief that dialogue, participation and consensus build social peace. To cite a concrete example, at the height of the pandemic, we promoted a bicentennial pact initiative on the theme of closing gaps, designed as a point of contact for Panamanian society, as a way to develop a framework for how it sees itself in the future — and we see a country with a common good for all that is prosperous, safe and lives in peace. A total of 186,182 proposals were freely presented as possible solutions to problems encountered in the population. From that broad consultation, there have emerged national agreements that respond to the real concerns of the Panamanian people and transcend governmental term periods.
The destabilization of fuel prices also led to demonstrations and protests in Panama, primarily owing to the increase in the costs of food, medicine and gasoline. Instead of confrontation, President Cortizo opted for dialogue. Nobody in our country lost their life during those protests. Our governing style has enabled agreement and consensus where the deepest needs of the population are concerned. Our national Government has articulated concrete provisions and measures. And it is very important to point out that we have been able to ensure social peace. In the global context, dialogue is the only way to reduce the space for extremism.
Accessible medicine is the difference between life and death. President Cortizo has decided to confront that issue with courage and political will. To that end, he instructed me to establish and organize our country’s national Commission of Medicines with a view to securing a supply of medicines for our population, with prices much lower than the current ones. The pharmaceutical industry, including the production, supply and distribution of medicines in the world, is supposed to contribute to people’s health; however, we note with concern that millions of people cannot access medicines. That access has become a cold, businesslike exchange. The oligopolies earn disproportionately high profits from the medicines they distribute and sell to both Governments and private individuals. Such a system, which is shameful for humankind, cannot continue.
It is everyone’s responsibility — and we must examine and address the global implications — to ensure that access to medicines is valued as a human right and not as an expensive luxury commodity. Panama calls on the General Assembly to adopt a global initiative to solve the issue of the excessively high prices of medicines and their inaccessibility to the people of the world.
Panama is in fact a transit country for irregular migration. Thousands of people transit through the Darien Gap jungle crossing on the border with Colombia. It is a dangerous and treacherous crossing, where people risk their lives, get sick and die. We are not just a transit country for migration. Also included in that context are criminal organizations engaged in the nefarious business of human trafficking. Our Government has adopted a State policy for addressing and providing assistance to migrants, with a particular emphasis on humanity and solidarity. We emphasize that the possible solutions to this painful and regrettable situation can be provided by the origin countries, whose poverty and social marginalization determine irregular migration, as well as those of us are affected by the transits, especially the countries of destination.
Our Government believes that the current development model must be transformed to take into account the value of biodiversity and to promote healthy and sustainable ecosystems. Panama is one of the three carbon-negative countries in the world. Some 35 per cent of our national territory and 30.5 per cent of our seas have been declared as natural protected areas. More than 80 per cent of our electricity generation comes from renewable sources. In July of this year alone, we achieved a new historic record: 95 per cent of the energy generated to supply our national matrix was clean energy. Our country ranks eighth in the world for clean-energy generation.
President Cortizo’s energy transition agenda has strengthened Panama’s global leadership in combating
climate change. Panamanians have a historical awareness of the value of our geographic position because of the presence of the Panama Canal and the role it plays in the world economy. We are a country with a mission to protect its natural resources.
Young people are harshly critical of the many forums, summits and declarations on climate change and the preservation of the environment and natural resources that continue to be held while emissions and deforestation increase without restraint, along with the contamination of water, aquifers, rivers and oceans. How can we win the trust of new generations while the planet where we live, and our descendants will have to live, is being destroyed before their eyes? How many more lives must be lost? How many more natural disasters must take place? I wonder: when are they going to stop the ecocide? From this rostrum, we remind the big emitters of gases, those that encourage deforestation and those that dump chemicals that pollute and kill, that it is matter of the survival of the Earth and the species that inhabit it. Today, before this gathering of nations, Panama proposes that the time has come for the world to have an international body to hold all those that inflict damage on the planet accountable.
The future depends on every decision that we take now. It is no longer viable to take the wrong direction and then try to correct it. The path of conflict and war leads to more calamities and disasters. It is the wrong path.
Because of its geography and ethnic and cultural diversity, Panama is a country of openness and common ground. Situated at one of the main maritime corridors in the world, at the centre of the American continent, we Panamanians are always ready to serve humankind, as we have done for centuries.
Today, before the General Assembly, we want to resolutely say to the world that it depends, and will always depend, on Panama. The times we live in have changed. The world that was is no more. Ahead of us, we have the challenge of building another world — a better world, with answers to ensure human health and life on this planet, which is our home, a world with greater solidarity and peace. We must succeed. United, we will always be much stronger."
Peru,PER,South America,"  31,989,000 ",11540,3.59100008,5.7,76.516,Neoplasm,Cardiovascular Disease,Lower Respiratory Infection,903,2.82,"  31,768,856 ",99.31,8.63,"On behalf of the Peruvian people, we warmly congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly. I am convinced that his broad diplomatic experience and commitment to environmental issues will contribute to the success of our work. I also commend and thank Secretary- General Antonio Guterres for his initiatives to promote more efficient and fairer global governance and for the hard work he is doing in a troubled world that demands strong leadership.
The international situation is complex, difficult and delicate. Strategic balances are shifting, and our peoples are concerned about the worsening context with regard to peace, the environment and the international economic situation. The world is moving dangerously towards situations of confrontation and opposed interests, which are creating serious tensions that are unprecedented in history.
Peru reaffirms its firm position in defence of the principle of non-aggression and respect for the territorial integrity of States. We reiterate that Russian Federation’s intervention in Ukraine is illegitimate, as well as our condemnation of Israel’s ongoing occupation of Palestinian and Arab territories since 1967. The selective application the Charter of the United Nations is not conducive to peace. All armed interventions are in violation of the Charter — there is no such thing as good or bad interventions. Similarly, all sanctions, other than those approved by the Security Council as part of its actions to preserve peace and security, are illegitimate and contrary to international law. I repeat, all other types of unilateral sanctions, including economic sanctions, are illegitimate and contrary to international law.
When a war or aggression breaks out, it is the duty of the international community to work towards a ceasefire and a peaceful settlement of the conflict through diplomatic negotiations. We must not encourage conflict but rather make peace our mission. Peru therefore once again reiterates the need for a ceasefire in Ukraine. We call for enhancing the protection of civil society affected by the conflict and for negotiations to be launched in order to find a peaceful solution that takes the interests of all parties into account. At the same time, we need to ensure that the agreement enabling the export of grain from Ukraine continues and, as the Secretary-General has pointed out, make arrangements to normalize Russian fertilizer exports, the shortage of which is burdening the poorest farmers in the developing world. It is crucial to prevent economic sanctions from affecting food security. Ultimately, it is a matter of ensuring respect for the human right to food.
Regarding the question of Palestine, whose territories witnessed a surge of violence a few months ago, it is also essential for the international community to shoulder its responsibilities once and for all and support peace negotiations geared towards finding a solution based on recognizing both States — an independent and viable Palestine and an Israel with secure borders. That is the only way to secure a lasting peace. The Government of Peru will soon open a diplomatic outpost in Palestine, in full compliance with the principle of universality of diplomatic relations.
Given the context of instability and the fact that we are losing the capacity to use consensus and diplomatic negotiations to transform centres of conflict into peacebuilding situations, it is essential to take a leap forward in strengthening and expanding the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations. At the request of my Government, Peru has nearly doubled its number of military personnel in six peacekeeping missions around the world, especially in the peacemaking and stabilization process in the Central African Republic. We are also committed to making short-term police contributions.
Just a few days ago, in Lima, I opened the first Latin American and Caribbean Conference on Peacekeeping Operations on the theme “Living in Peace”. The convening of the Conference demonstrates a determined push to increase the participation of Latin America and the Caribbean in United Nations peacekeeping operations, in accordance with the principles of consent of the parties, impartiality and the non-use of force, except in legitimate self-defence. More importantly, the Lima Conference made the decision to establish a Latin American and Caribbean network for cooperation in peacekeeping operations. Peru is committed to ensuring the immediate set-up and launch of the network. Latin America, which played a decisive role in establishing the United Nations, must, through solidarity and joint action, step up its contribution to conflict resolution and peace. That is its historical tradition.
In that regard, my Government will be ramping up the consultations to establish South America as a zone of international peace. As indicated in the preamble to the UNESCO constitution, since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defence of peace must be constructed. Building the values of peace in the minds of men means respecting others, protecting human rights and not exploiting the weakest, as well as promoting dialogue and the peaceful settlement of disputes. But above all, it means eradicating — as the United Nations systematically does, with the permanent support of Peru — hateful ideologies, racism, intolerance, xenophobia and anti-Semitism. Peace, on the other hand, requires us to acknowledge that humankind has a common destiny.
Acting responsibly to build that common future means respecting the principle of non-intervention and, at the same time, showing solidarity with the poor, the weak, the dispossessed and the vulnerable. Acting responsibly to build that common future means respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms; civil and political rights; economic, social and cultural rights; the collective rights of peoples and the rights
of indigenous peoples. States have a duty not only to guarantee their peoples’ freedom but also to ensure that they can enjoy the social rights that underpin human dignity, including the human rights to education, health, housing, water, food, a living wage and, thanks to the General Assembly, the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.
Peacebuilding also involves fulfilling the mandate to resolve the still-pending situation of colonial peoples and territories. Peru fought for its independence in the early nineteenth century based on the principle of self- determination of peoples. Peru’s diplomacy since 1947 has therefore firmly supported and continues to support granting independence and self-determination to the territories and peoples that are under the mandate of the United Nations to ensure their independence.
Peru has re-established diplomatic relations with the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic and firmly supports its right to self-determination. The actions to be taken by the Special Representative of the Secretary- General to re-establish the ceasefire in the Western Sahara and promote a negotiated and peaceful solution have our widest support. In the same vein, Peru fully recognizes the Argentina’s sovereignty rights of the over the Malvinas Islands and urges the parties to begin consultations and negotiations in order to realize that crucial objective.
The international economic situation is becoming dire. The pandemic’s negative effects on production processes and, especially, the deterioration it has entailed in the living standards of the poor and extremely poor majorities, as well as the problems it has created in the regularization of supply chains, inflation and rising energy prices, are unleashing a major world crisis, which will cause more poverty and exclusion.
Global growth indicators are not encouraging; indeed, global growth is declining. Latin America is suffering the negative effects of inflation and the decline of economic growth. It is also struggling to restore its efforts to combat poverty and extreme poverty to their pre-pandemic levels. The region has increasingly high rates of debt that are difficult to sustain.
In order to address those global and regional trends, which are affecting opportunities for potential growth, Peru has adopted a plan to boost economic growth known as Impulso Peru. Our definitive goal is, in all cases, to grow the economy by 3.3 per cent above the average target for Latin America. We are convinced that our most important objective should be to create more better-quality jobs, and to that end, we are promoting and improving conditions for national and foreign investment. The plan also makes special considerations for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. Peru is a country with stable and positive macroeconomic variables, an economy open to private and public investment for the benefit of those who need it most.
Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has raised the need for a new global social compact. That new commitment needs to be linked to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, which are now seriously compromised. We need to reaffirm our political will to ensure that the United Nations development system, within the framework of all its agencies, prioritizes achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development goals in the most critical areas of our times, including the reduction by half the proportion of people living in poverty; eradicating extreme poverty; making zero hunger a reality to provide food security for all families; achieving efficient and universal health coverage for all; ensuring that all boys and girls complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education; ending all forms of discrimination against women and girls worldwide; achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all; and progressively achieving and sustaining income growth for the poorest 40 per cent of the population at a rate higher than the national average.
We need to ensure the strength and effectiveness of the new global compact by renewing our commitment to focusing our political will and financial resources on meeting the 2030 Agenda goals. The 2030 Agenda is not only a programme for peace, justice and equality at the global level; it is also on essential part of our national agendas.
This year, extreme heat and flooding have reached record-high levels as a result of climate change. Greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise. Those are Mother Earth’s warning calls for us end our assault on nature. I call especially on the industrialized nations to give a new impetus to curbing global warming. As Heads of State, we must acknowledge that our targets for meeting our commitments to reducing new emissions already need to be seven times higher in order to achieve our goal of keeping the planet’s temperature from rising more than 1.5°C. The United Nations has
reaffirmed its support for protecting the rights and lives of environmental defenders and for ensuring access to information on the environment for citizens and indigenous peoples.
The Regional Agreement on Access to Information, Public Participation and Justice in Environmental Matters in Latin America and the Caribbean, known as the Escazu Agreement, which Peru has signed, reflects the efforts of the peoples of Latin America to implement the General Assembly’s historic resolution 76/300, on recognizing environmental rights as human rights. The Escazu Agreement is an instrument to affirm our sovereignty over natural resources in the Amazon.
The oceans also require urgent compacts to preserve marine life and ecosystems and their biodiversity. Peru supports negotiations for a treaty to regulate fishing activities and eradicate pollution of the seas beyond 200 miles from their coasts. We firmly reiterate our claim to our maritime zone up to 200 miles, as established in our Constitution.
Latin America has a democratic tradition, yet it also has the highest levels of social inequality. But the Latin American peoples continue to move forward with the historical strength of the justness of their cause in the search for fairer, more egalitarian societies with greater social cohesion, where the common good is for all and there is no exclusion. That is the path we are on in Peru.
Democracy by its very nature involves conflicting political positions. That is what freedom is all about. But democratic governance requires respect for institutions and, above all, for the will of the people. Coups d’etat, regardless of how they are orchestrated or the power of the States promoting them, are illegitimate. They are an attack on the sovereign expression of the will of the people. In the same way we address external crises, any crisis of governance or confrontation involving the powers of the State must be resolved through dialogue, agreement and full respect for the electoral results. The Inter-American Democratic Charter, Peru’s contribution to democracy in the Americas, emphatically establishes that principle.
In a world where both tendencies to conflict and internal political crises are increasing, we need four pillars for defending democratic governance: respect for peoples, willingness to resolve conflicts through negotiation, respect for human rights and respect for the institution of the rule of law.
I am Head of State of a multi-ethnic and multicultural country whose development of high civilizations dates back more than 3,000 years, and which has also faced difficulties in eliminating racism and social inequality. My Government reflects the demands, hopes and dreams of those who have had nothing or very little to help them integrate into civic life as actors in their own destiny. Peru’s social inclusion agenda mirrors the new social compact that the United Nations wants for all the peoples of the world.
It is an agenda that prioritizes the principle of leaving no one behind, as well as inclusion that benefits all people, especially the poorest and most vulnerable — for a world for all."
Philippines,PHL,Asia,"  106,651,000 ",7223,2.345999956,5.9,71.095,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Lower Respiratory Infection,2325,2.18,"  103,283,371 ",96.84,7.49,"I am Ferdinand Marcos, and I am President of the Republic of the Philippines. I stand here today on behalf of 110 million Filipinos. At this time of crisis and opportunity, I bring with me the spirit of their enduring commitment to the ideals of our United Nations.
That commitment is reflected in our solid contributions to the cause of peace and justice. By shepherding through the Manila Declaration of 1982, we helped affirm that differences should be resolved only through peaceful means. By reinforcing the predictability and stability of international law, particularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, we provided an example of how States should resolve their differences, through reason and right. Those two contributions provide useful guidance for our time, for amid challenging global tides, an important ballast is the stabilization of our common vessel, that is, our open, inclusive and rules-based international order, governed by international law and informed by the principles of equity and justice. As I have underscored, the Philippines will continue to be a friend to all and an enemy of none.
Our world order traces its roots to a moment 77 years ago. The President of the General Assembly’s first predecessor from Asia, General Carlos Romulo, called on our leaders then to make this floor our last battlefield in order to determine in this Hall whether humankind was to survive or be wiped out in another holocaust. Our peoples chose survival, cooperation and peace, and by doing so, they made history.
Today, history once again calls on us to make those choices. We are confronted by tectonic shifts that will inform the ebb and flow of the coming century. Of those, I see four challenges to the continued survival of our global community.
The first challenge is climate change. The time for talk about if and when has long since passed — it is here and now. Climate change is the greatest threat affecting our nations and peoples. There is no other problem so global in nature that it requires a united effort led by the United Nations.
The effects of climate change are uneven and reflect a historical injustice whereby those who are least responsible suffer the most. The Philippines, for example, is a net carbon sink. We absorb more carbon dioxide than we emit. Yet we are the fourth most vulnerable country to the effects of climate change.
That injustice must be corrected and those who need to do more must act now. We accept our share of responsibility and will continue to do our part to avert that collective disaster.
We call on industrialized countries to immediately fulfil their obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions, provide climate financing and technology transfer for the adaptation of the most vulnerable and developing countries and lead by example. We look forward to concrete outcomes at the Conference of the Parties to the Convention to be held in Egypt later this year. When future generations look back, let them not ask why we did not take this opportunity to turn the tide, or why we continued in our profligate ways until it was too late. The threat knows no borders, no social class, nor any geopolitical consideration. How we address it will be the true test of our time.
Secondly, the development of advanced technologies is rapidly transforming human life and experience. We still barely understand how those transformations are unfolding and where they are leading. The imminent diffusion of those emerging technologies could solve many of our old problems, but could also disrupt our political and social orders. Our governance structures must keep up.
Thirdly, widening geopolitical polarities and sharpening strategic competitions are transforming the international political landscape. A profound lack of trust is putting enormous strains on our multilateral system. The Charter of the United Nations itself is being violated around the world as we speak. In Asia, our hard- won peace and stability is under threat from increasing strategic and ideological tensions. They demand that we uphold the ideals that led to the establishment of this parliament of nations and reject any attempt to deny or redefine our common understanding of those principles.
Even as we grapple with those new long-term shifts, we remain beset by an unresolved problem, the inequalities and inequities that persist within and among countries, and that continue to demand urgent action. Therein lies our fourth transcendent challenge. That injustice was evident during the pandemic, when the richer nations immediately received vaccines at the expense of the have-nots. We see, for example, similar dangers lurking in the persistent digital divide and in ballooning debt burdens.
As we awaken from the economic stupor caused by the pandemic, we must reinvigorate the world economy. We must use public and private resources to encourage the expansion of trade, investment and technology transfers to accelerate development. Knowledge and intellectual gains must flow freely to allow those lagging behind to catch up. Sustainable development will be hampered to the detriment of all if existing structures in the global economy remain unreformed.
In the past three decades, Filipinos have made significant strides on their path to sustainable development. Despite the challenges of the pandemic and global economic upheavals, we remain on track to reach upper-middle-income status by next year. With steady investment in food, public health, education and other social services, we expect to become a moderately prosperous country by 2040. I am confident that we will achieve that vision. Yet no nation stands alone. The achievement of our national ambition requires a global environment that creates conditions that allow all nations, including ours, to thrive in peace. We need the United Nations to continue to work and we in the Philippines are determined to be part of that solution.
The Philippines did not hesitate to donate to the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Facility that helped provide vaccines in many parts of the developing world. Multilateralism and international cooperation do make a difference. Filipino health workers were on the front lines in many countries to curb the spread of the virus, risking and often sacrificing their own lives to save those of others. We have always been an optimistic and courageous nation. Despite the enormity of those challenges, we believe that solutions are within our collective grasp. The President of the Assembly has already identified the three tools at our disposal.
The first of those tools is solidarity. We need to reaffirm the wisdom of the founders of our United Nations. That means transcending our differences and committing to ending war, upholding justice, respecting human rights and maintaining international peace and security.
Nuclear weapons continue to pose an existential threat, despite our efforts to build norms that resoundingly prohibit them. We must reject the notion of deterrence and remain committed to decreasing the global stockpile of those weapons. At the same time, we must also address the scourge of the proliferation of all weapons, be they small arms, light weapons or improvised explosive devices.
Our work must also focus on ensuring that the international system remains fair, not only for all States but more importantly for all peoples. The system must work for the most vulnerable, especially the marginalized, including migrants and refugees. The world has witnessed the enduring contribution of migrants in the fight against the pandemic. We are still dreaming of an end to the disturbing incidents of racism, of Asian hate and of all prejudice.
The Philippines’ joint programme on human rights with the United Nations is an example of a constructive approach that puts our people rather than our politics at the centre of that work. It provides a model for revitalizing the structures that facilitate solidarity between the United Nations and a sovereign duty- bearer. Our continued solidarity will also benefit from a reformed and more inclusive Security Council and an empowered General Assembly that can hold the Council to account.
At the same time, the United Nations must forge ahead with its flagship tradition of global peacekeeping. My country’s experiences in building peace and forging new paths of cooperation can enrich the work of the Security Council. To that end, I appeal for the valuable support of all Member States for the Philippines’ candidature for the Security Council for the 2027-2028 term.
Our success in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao in the south of the Philippines is the centrepiece of those efforts. The peace that we have forged after many decades of conflict among warring factions and clansmen demonstrates that unity is possible even in the most trying circumstances. Inclusive dialogue involving all stakeholders, including women, young people, faith leaders and civil society, conducted with patience and in good faith, has produced a credible and solid foundation for self-governance that will pave the way for lasting peace and sustainable development.
We take the same approach in Asia. The Philippines builds partnerships for peace and development through dialogue, including interfaith and interreligious dialogue, especially through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. In the face of great diversity, we believe that partnerships form the bridge that will unite us all in promoting peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.
Our global community is only as strong as we make it. We have to ensure that all nations, especially developing countries, are equipped with the tools
they need to navigate the uncharted waters of this century. That requires a transformative development agenda. We therefore welcome the convening of a United Nations summit of the future next year as an opportunity to collectively roll up our sleeves and chart our common path.
The second of those tools is sustainability. We must seek solutions that preserve our plane, solutions that must transcend our time and win the future for succeeding generations. We crafted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as a platform of unity where our societies can build a future that is resilient and inclusive and where our people can be healthy, happy and secure. That requires investment in food security, the fragility of which has been clearly demonstrated by the pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine. We need to take concrete steps towards a modern and resilient agriculture. Food is not just a trade commodity or a livelihood, it is an existential imperative as well as a moral one. It is the very basis of human security.
In order to attain food self-sufficiency and security, we are providing innovative solutions and financial support to farmers and fisherfolk to adapt new technologies and connect to national and global value supply chains. We look forward to forging cooperation with the United Nations and our partners to boost agricultural productivity and food security. As host to 17 United Nations agencies, programmes and funds, the Philippines strongly supports reforms to ensure that the United Nations development system delivers as one through its United Nations country team.
Water connects our world and sustains our existence, but it is also a finite resource that requires our stewardship. Our biodiversity is equally important and must be protected amid the continuing challenge of climate change. We must enhance our cooperation in those areas, but sustainability also requires development policies that go beyond traditional metrics. We already know that gross domestic product is an incomplete measure of progress and that vulnerability is multidimensional. Our development agenda must also take into account the interests of all developing nations, including middle-income countries, where the majority of the world’s poor live.
At the same time, sustainability means equipping our people with the tools they need to meet the challenges of the fourth industrial revolution. Investments in education are key, and my Administration is prepared to make such investments. The Philippines notes with appreciation the Transforming Education Summit held earlier this week, at which those subjects were taken up. There is perhaps no greater renewable resource than the creativity and innovation of our young people. We understand the value of harnessing our people’s talents by creating a robust and creative economy, and we will continue to work with partners in promoting that at the international level.
The third and final tool is science. Knowledge and discovery remain the keys to unlocking the potential of our dynamic future. Encouraging our young people’s curiosity, honing their skills and protecting their intellectual property are important investments. Humankind is expanding its horizons, both in the digital world and out in our physical universe. Access to those domains is an inalienable right of all nations, as is the peaceful use of all existing and emerging technologies.
The Philippines is preparing for the future by laying a governance framework that will enable us to harness the power of renewable energy, develop the capacity to utilize life sciences such as medicine and virology, pursue digital solutions towards a more modern economy and expand our presence in outer space. But we also need to update the global structures that facilitate international cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, biology and chemistry, to name but a few. At the same time, we need new structures to govern rapid advances in other areas. We need to start by defining the norms of responsible behaviour in cyberspace and outer space and forming legal rules that will prevent the weaponization of artificial intelligence.
The diffusion of cutting-edge technology across the economy is promising, but it could come at a cost. Our development agenda must consider the possible displacement of human labour as a result of advances in automation. We must prepare our economic structures for that. We should start building the necessary supports for the sectors affected.
The transcendent challenges of our time are as consequential as those that faced us 77 years ago when we founded this body. We are indeed at a watershed moment, one that requires a refounding of this our United Nations. The world is ready for transformation. It is up to us, as leaders of our nations, to move and shape that transformation. The future beckons, and we can embark on that journey as single nations or as a world in harmony. I say, let the challenges of one people be the challenges for all nations. In that way the success of one will be a success for us all.
The peoples of the world look to their leaders, to us, to make these aspirations for our future a reality. We must not fail them. And if we stand together, we will not fail them. If we stand together, we can only succeed. Let us dream, let us work for those successes for all our nations, united."

They made a commitment to maintain international peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations and “save succeeding generations the scourge of war”. Seventy-seven years later, we have still not achieved those goals. Around the world, many children, and even many adults, have never known peace.
In Europe today we are confronted with the unjustified and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in flagrant violation of international law, in particular the Charter of the United Nations. It is a war with devastating effects for the Ukrainian people, brutally affecting the civilian population. The gravity of the acts committed makes an independent, impartial and transparent investigation imperative so that the crimes committed do not go unpunished.
Therefore, we cannot fail to once again condemn the Russian aggression and emphasize Portugal’s support for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Russia must cease hostilities and allow for a serious and sustained dialogue towards a ceasefire and peace. This is not the time for Russia to escalate the conflict or to make irresponsible threats to resort to nuclear weapons.
We welcome the efforts of the entire United Nations system, in particular its Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, to resolve the conflict and to mitigate its damaging effects, such as the food crisis. It has once again been the most vulnerable who have felt the impact of the energy and food crisis the most, after being buffeted by almost three years of the pandemic.
That is why we reiterate our solidarity with all those around the world, particularly in Africa, who are suffering from the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That is also why it is important to make it clear and unequivocal that the necessary sanctions applied to Russia cannot affect, directly or indirectly, the production, transportation and payment of cereals and fertilizers.
Peace was not definitively won in 1945, but the world has changed radically since then. We need a representative, agile and functioning Security Council that is able to respond to the challenges of the twenty-first century without becoming paralysed, and whose actions are scrutinized by the other Members of the United Nations. We need a Security Council that incorporates a comprehensive view of security, recognizing, inter alia, the role of climate change as an accelerator of conflict — a Security Council where the African continent, and at least Brazil and India, have seats and where small countries are more fairly represented.
A global vision of security is essential, based on the New Agenda for Peace advocated by Secretary-General Guterres — an agenda focused on conflict prevention and capable of ensuring adequate, predictable and sustainable funding for peacebuilding.
As the international community, it is our duty to support the efforts of African nations for the stability of their continent, seeking African solutions to African problems. The worsening security and humanitarian context in the Sahel also requires a concerted and multidimensional effort, ensuring humanitarian assistance to populations affected by the multiple crises that plague the region.
The evolving terrorist threat around the world, particularly in Mozambique, the Sahel and the Gulf of Guinea, requires a targeted and effective response from the international community.
Over the past decades, my country has established itself as a reliable partner for global peace and stability. At the service of the United Nations, we are currently present in four theatres of peacekeeping operations, including in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic. I am very proud of the recognition that our military and security forces have received for their contribution to crisis and conflict management on all continents under the aegis of the United Nations, NATO or the European Union.
It is undeniable that there is a link between climate and security. Today more than ever, we are feeling the effects of climate change — heat waves or intense cold, droughts, fires, floods and storms. Countries, such as Portugal, that suffer from coastal erosion, increased droughts and the tragedy of forest fires clearly understand the urgency of climate action. Neither is it necessary to explain it to countries like Pakistan, which today is suffering the truly devastating consequences of the rest of the world’s climate inaction, or to coastal countries, particularly small island nations, which see their livelihoods threatened year after year by rising sea waters.
We hope that the twenty-seventh Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to be held in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, can be a time that leads to an inclusive transition, ensuring a more balanced allocation of climate financing between mitigation and adaptation.
Portugal has been at the forefront of the decarbonization process, having been the first to commit to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 as early as the twenty-second Conference of the States Parties to the UNFCCC, held in Marrakesh. We believe that that goal is feasible from an economic and technological point of view and will promote employment and generate social justice.
We will seek to accelerate those commitments, as we already did with our goal of ending electricity production from coal, which we achieved last year. By 2026, we want to increase the percentage of renewables in the electricity consumed in Portugal from 60 per cent to 80 per cent. To that end, we will continue our strong investment in solar, wind and ocean energies, and we will invest in the use of renewable gases, such as green hydrogen.
The President took the Chair.
The sea is one of the platforms where climate is projected. We welcome the active participation of all States in the second Ocean Conference, which we had the honour of co-organizing with Kenya. The Lisbon Declaration represents a genuine action plan for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 14, on the conservation and sustainable use of ocean resources.
As part of the commitments made by the various countries and entities present, Portugal also reiterated its commitment to protecting at least 30 per cent of
marine areas by 2030. We went further; by the end of the decade, we want 100 per cent of the maritime space under Portuguese sovereignty or jurisdiction to be assessed as being in a good environmental status.
After Lisbon, there remains much work to be done on the ocean agenda. I am sure that France and Costa Rica will continue the work undertaken by Portugal and Kenya in recent years with redoubled energy. We therefore call for the conclusion of negotiations on a post-2020 global biodiversity framework that enshrines the 30-by-30 target. We also support progress in the negotiations of the treaty on marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdictions by the end of this year.
The transition to a prosperous future — a green and digital future — can leave no one behind. Social policies must be at the heart of our action, the development of our economies and the fight against climate change. We therefore support the preparatory process for the Social Summit, proposed by the Secretary-General.
We must also continue to work to ensure effective and equitable immunization worldwide, improve the global health architecture and find ways to respond more quickly, in a coordinated and decisive manner, to future crises by adopting a genuine pandemic treaty.
The successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development plays mainly on the most vulnerable countries and populations.
All those challenges further highlight the universal, indivisible and independent nature of all human rights, whose respect, protection and promotion are a top priority of Portugal’s external and internal action. Imbued with the humanist spirit that our historical responsibility as forerunners of the abolition of the death penalty instils in us, we will continue to fight for its universal abolition.
No future will be truly transformative without pluralist, inclusive societies that promote gender equality and combat racial discrimination, racism, xenophobia and all forms of intolerance. In that regard, the fight for gender equality and women’s empowerment is absolutely crucial. If we do not achieve that, it will not be possible to meet our human rights obligations or the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
It is also crucial that we pay particular attention to the impact of conflict situations on the rights of women and girls and the fundamental role that they can play in processes to build and consolidate peace. I therefore want to reiterate Portugal’s support for the United Nations women and peace and security agenda.
As a country of emigration and immigration, we will continue to participate constructively in discussions on the global governance of migration. We will continue the good path that we have been following in our national territory, from the integration of migrants to the promotion of regular pathways for labour mobility. We have played an active role in welcoming migrants and refugees in a clear expression of solidarity, having welcomed refugees from Ukraine and Afghanistan, among other places.
The transformative potential of the United Nations is immense, but it must be given the tools to realize the high expectations placed on it by people around the world, particularly young people. One third of the world’s population is under 20 years old. It is therefore essential to ensure that young people participate in decision-making processes and that their voices be effectively heard. We will therefore continue to take a leading role in the youth agenda and support the work of the United Nations Youth Office.
The United Nations is the global forum for consultation among peoples. The challenges that we face today require that we continue to adapt our common home, making it more efficient, fairer and more representative. Portugal is ready to make its contribution. We are therefore candidates to the Security Council for the two-year term from 2027 to 2028. We once again hope to merit the trust of Member States, because only together can we build a more peaceful, more sustainable, more inclusive and more prosperous future.
The strengthening of multilateralism is not an option. It is an absolute necessity in order to deal with global challenges. Today it is time to move from words to action, with more cooperation, more solidarity and more multilateralism. Portugal, as always, will not miss that call."
Romania,ROU,Europe,"  19,506,000 ",18913,4.929999828,6.2,75.924,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,1886,9.67,"  19,506,000 ",100.00,8.37,"We live in difficult times. Our predecessors, who adopted the Charter of the United Nations, were “determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”. Almost eight decades later, peace is still under threat, this time from worrying new challenges — the most severe since the end of the Second World War.
Since 24 February we have been witnessing the tragic consequences of the unprovoked and illegal war started by the Russian Federation, a permanent member of the Security Council, against Ukraine. We have also witnessed exceptional solidarity from numerous countries united in their support for Ukraine, a sovereign member of the General Assembly and a victim of months of aggression against its civilians, basic infrastructure and economy.
The consequences of the war are global and are not limited to our security. They refer to blatant violations of norms and principles of international law, including international humanitarian law, fundamental human rights and sustainable development worldwide. Those should be of major concern for all of us, irrespective of how far we are from the conflict.
There is no justification for a military aggression against a sovereign State. There is no justification for bloodshed, destruction or human suffering. It is our joint responsibility to come together and uphold our common values as Members of the United Nations.
Democracy and universal human rights are legitimate aspirations for all humankind. We therefore need to act now and support all who fight for freedom and democracy. We should guarantee respect for the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of all States.
Romania supported and will continue to support Ukraine, as its people are also fighting for our values and democracy. Romania has opened its frontiers and its heart to all those seeking refuge from the war in Ukraine. Since the beginning of the conflict, more than 2.3 million Ukrainians have crossed our borders. Romania has offered not only emergency assistance, but also medium- and long-term support for those who have decided to stay in our country, with free access to education, health services and the labour market. In addition, we have offered direct humanitarian assistance and put in place a logistics hub for coordinating international humanitarian assistance from the entire world. Our support will not stop there.
We know that our response, especially to this war, will shape our common future. Our support for peace should be voiced now louder than ever. In defending our universal values, it is essential to stay united and bring everyone on board, including those who are still hesitating. Engagement and dialogue are crucial to overcoming divisions and, at the same time, to countering the spread of falsehoods and propaganda.
The challenges we face today —such as the impact of climate change and the loss of biodiversity, energy insecurity, the lack of access to food and education, and social inequities — are becoming more and more severe. They need responses and solutions, as our citizens are rightfully asking for them. For all those issues, common action is the only way forward.
Energy security is a global concern, requiring joint solutions and responsible action. We must avoid the use of energy as a tool of blackmail. Energy security requires strategic investments in renewables, in nuclear power — with new future-oriented projects, such as small modular reactors — or in hydrogen. It also requires energy prices that are accessible to our citizens.
Ensuring energy security goes hand in hand with the green transition for resilient and climate-neutral economies. The nexus between climate change and peace and security should be more prominent in our discussions, including in the Security Council. Despite our efforts, we have not moved past the triple crisis of climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss. All our efforts in the European Union and in coordination with international partners are meant to identify and implement the best solutions to those serious difficulties.
In two months’ time, we shall meet in Egypt for the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and additional commitments towards climate neutrality are necessary, along with the implementation of the decisions already made. The clock is ticking, and the planet cannot wait any longer. Raising awareness, educating future generations on environmental protection and fighting climate change is of utmost importance and a topic very close to my heart.
Education is a top priority for Romania and a strategic investment in our future. Therefore, we also look forward to the Summit of the Future, to be held in 2024.
Weaponizing access to food and restricting it around the world is unacceptable. In order to support the Ukrainian economy and help manage the global food crisis, Romania has acted in a responsible way by facilitating the export of more than 4 million tons of Ukrainian grain, which represents 60 per cent of the grain exported by Ukraine, through our ports on the Danube and the Black Sea since the beginning of the crisis. We also commend the role of the Secretary-General in reaching the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which is, as he symbolically put it, a beacon of hope in a world that truly needs it.
Romania has long argued for keeping the so-called protracted or frozen conflicts high on our agenda and for focusing on how to solve them. The war against Ukraine has taught us that, in such contexts, the absence of war does not mean peace. Protracted conflicts, such as those in the Black Sea region, need to be addressed without delay.
United Nations peacekeeping has always been an instrument of paramount importance in safeguarding peace and security. Romania’s solid contribution to various operations around the globe stands as proof of our commitment. We need to ensure that, in line with the Action for Peacekeeping agenda, United Nations peacekeeping missions become more effective and contribute to political solutions to conflicts, placing human rights at the core of their action.
We also need steadfast action by the international community to protect and promote human rights. We must strengthen the United Nations human rights system and ensure the sustainable and adequate funding of all its activities.
We recognize the essential role played by civil society actors and human rights defenders in the promotion and protection of human rights. Ensuring the proper functioning of democratic institutions, upholding respect for the rule of law and guaranteeing fundamental rights and freedoms remains fundamental. It is with these firm convictions that Romania has presented its candidacy for a seat on the Human Rights Council for the term 2023-2025.
I would like to conclude by stressing that we need to restore public trust in effective multilateralism. Only together will we be able to identify and implement sustainable solutions in order to achieve world peace, prosperity, the fulfillment of human rights and a healthy environment for future generations."
Russia,RUS,Europe,"  145,734,000 ",23064,5.199999809,5.5,72.386,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Digestive Disease,36625,25.13,"  145,734,000 ",100.00,10.90,"We are meeting at a difficult and dramatic moment. Crises are growing, and the international security situation is deteriorating rapidly. Instead of honest dialogue and compromise, what we have is disinformation, coarse statements and provocations. The West’s policy is undermining trust in international institutions as bodies designed to reconcile different interests, and in international law as a guarantee of fairness and of the protection of the weak against arbitrary acts. We are witnessing negative trends in a concentrated fashion at the United Nations, which arose from the rubble of German fascism and Japanese militarism and was established to promote friendly relations and prevent conflicts among its members.
Issues relating to the future world order are being decided today, as any unbiased observer can clearly see. The question is whether that world order will have a single hegemon that forces everyone else to live by its infamous rules, benefiting it alone, or whether we will have a democratic and fair world, free from blackmail and intimidation of anyone deemed undesirable, a world without neo-Nazism and neocolonialism. Russia is resolute in choosing the latter option, and together with our allies, partners and like-minded countries, we call for working to make it a reality. The unipolar model of global development serving the interests of the one per cent, who for centuries fuelled its excessive consumption at the expense of the resources of Asia, Africa and Latin America, is receding into the past. Today, with the emergence of sovereign States that are ready to defend their national interests, an equal, socially oriented and sustainable multipolar architecture is taking shape. However, Washington, and the Western ruling elites that have fully submitted to its rule, view those objective geopolitical processes as a threat to their dominance.
The United States and its allies want to stop the march of history. Having at some point declared victory in the Cold War, Washington elevated itself almost to the level of God’s messenger on Earth, free of constraints and with a sacred right to act with impunity wherever and however it wants. Any State could be declared its next target, especially if it has somehow displeased the self-proclaimed masters of the universe. We all remember the wars of aggression that were unleashed far from American shores and on far-fetched pretexts in Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya, claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands of peaceful civilians. Were the West’s legitimate interests really at stake in even one of those countries? Were there bans there on English or other languages of NATO’s member States, or on the Western media or culture? Were Anglo-Saxons declared subhuman and heavy weapons used against them? What became of the United States’ adventurism in the Middle East? Has it improved the human rights situation or the rule of law? Has it stabilized the socioeconomic situation or improved people’s welfare? Name one country where life has changed for the better as a result of Washington’s interference by force.
In its attempts to revive a unipolar model under the banner of a rules-based order, the West has established dividing lines everywhere based on the notion of confrontation between blocs and the spirit of “either you are with us or against us”. There is no third option or possibility for compromise. In a continuation of its irrational policy of expanding NATO eastward and bringing NATO’s military infrastructure close to the borders of Russia, the United States now wants to subjugate Asia. At the NATO summit in June in Madrid, the self-proclaimed defensive alliance declared the security of the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions indivisible. Closed frameworks are being created under the banner of Indo-Pacific strategies that undermine the entire open and inclusive regional architecture that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations has built over decades. On top of that, it is playing with fire regarding Taiwan, going so far as to promise it military support.
The notorious Monroe Doctrine is clearly becoming global in scope. Washington is trying to make the entire world its own backyard. Its tool for coercing those who disagree is illegal unilateral sanctions, which for many years now have been used in violation of the Charter of the United Nations as an instrument of political blackmail. The cynicism of that practice is obvious, since the restrictions affect civilians, preventing their access to basic goods, including medicines, vaccines and food. One such egregious example is the United States’ blockade of Cuba, which has gone on for more than 60 years, and whose lifting an overwhelming majority of the General Assembly has been demanding urgently for decades. The Secretary-General, whose duties include facilitating the implementation of the General Assembly resolutions, should of course give that issue special attention.
The Secretary-General also has a special role to play in mobilizing the efforts to overcome the food and energy crises that have resulted from the uncontrolled printing of money in the United States and the European Union (EU) during the pandemic, as well as the EU’s irresponsible and unprofessional actions in the hydrocarbon fuel markets. Defying elementary common sense, Washington and Brussels have compounded the situation by declaring an economic war against Russia, and the result has been higher prices globally for food, fertilizer, oil and gas. We welcomed the Secretary-General’s efforts to help broker the Istanbul agreements of 22 July, but those agreements have to be implemented. So far, most of the ships carrying Ukrainian grain have not been directed to the poorest countries, and the financial and logistical obstacles to Russia’s exports of grain and fertilizer imposed by the United States and the EU have not been completely removed. We have pointing out for weeks that 300,000 tonnes of fertilizer are being held up in European ports and have proposed shipping them free of charge to the African countries that need them, but the European Union has not responded.
Official Russophobia in the West has taken on unprecedented and grotesque dimensions, with some unhesitatingly declaring their intention not just to defeat Russia militarily but to destroy and dismember it — in other words, to wipe off the world map a geopolitical entity that has become too independent. How have Russia’s actions over the past decades actually encroached on its opponents’ interests? Could it be that they cannot forgive the fact that Russia’s position made the military and strategic detente of the 1980s and ’90s possible? Or is it that we voluntarily dissolved the Warsaw Treaty Organization, thereby depriving NATO of its raison d’etre? Or that contrary to positions in London and Paris, we supported German reunification unconditionally? Or withdrew our armed forces from Europe, Asia and Latin America, and recognized the independence of the former Soviet republics? Or believed Western leaders’ promises that they would not expand NATO eastward by an inch, and when the process started, we agreed to basically legitimize it by signing a Founding Act between Russia and NATO? Did we perhaps encroach on the West’s interests when we warned that bringing its military infrastructure closer to our borders was unacceptable?
Western arrogance and American exceptionalism became especially destructive after the end of the Cold War. As long ago as 1991, Paul Wolfowitz, then the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense, in a conversation with NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley Clark, acknowledged openly that
“[wjith the end of the Cold War, we can now use our military with impunity.... And we’ve got five, maybe ten, years to clean up these old Soviet surrogate regimes like Iraq and Syria before the next superpower emerges to challenge us.”
I am sure that one day we will learn from someone’s memoirs how the United States built its policy on Ukraine, but Washington’s plans are already obvious even now.
Could it be that they simply cannot forgive us that at the request of the United States and the European Union we supported the agreement reached between the-then President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, and the opposition on resolving the crisis of February 2014, which was guaranteed by Germany, France and Poland — and was then trampled on the next morning by the ringleaders of the bloody coup, humiliating the European mediators? The West simply threw up its hands and looked on in silence as the putschists began bombing eastern Ukraine, where people refused to accept the results of the coup, just as they did when its organizers elevated the Nazi accomplices who took part in the brutal ethnic cleansing of Russians, Poles and Jews during the Second World War to the rank of national heroes. Were we supposed to stand idly by in the face of Kyiv’s policies imposing a total ban on the Russian language and on Russian education, media and culture, demanding that Russians be expelled from Crimea and declaring war on the Donbas — whose residents the Kyiv authorities, then and now, in the words of their most senior officials, have pronounced to be not people but mere creatures? Perhaps Russia was interfering with Western interests when it played a key role in stopping the hostilities unleashed by Kyiv’s neo-Nazis in eastern Ukraine and then insisted on the implementation of the Minsk package of measures — which was adopted unanimously by the Security Council in February 2015 but then killed by Kyiv with the direct involvement of the United States and the EU?
For many years we have repeatedly offered to agree on the rules for coexistence in Europe based on the principles of equal and indivisible security, as affirmed at the highest level in documents of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. According to those principles, no country can seek to strengthen its security at the expense of the security of others. The last time we proposed making those essential agreements legally binding was in December 2021 and we were met with an arrogant rejection.
The Western countries’ unwillingness to engage in talks and the Kyiv regime’s continuing war on its own people left us with no choice but to recognize the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics and launch a special military operation to protect the Russian and other residents of Donbas and eliminate the threats to our security that NATO has been consistently creating in Ukraine on what amounts to our borders. The operation is being carried out in accordance with the treaties of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance reached between Russia and those republics on the basis of Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations. I am certain that any self-respecting sovereign State conscious of its responsibility to its own people would have done the same in our place.
The West is having hysterics over the referendums in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhya oblasts of Ukraine, but the people there are merely responding to the Kyiv regime’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who in an interview in August 2021 advised all who considered themselves Russian to leave for Russia for their children and grandchildren’s sake. That is what the residents of those regions are doing now, and they are taking the lands where their forefathers lived for centuries with them. It is very clear to any unbiased observer that for the Anglo-Saxons, who have completely subjugated Europe, Ukraine is merely expendable material in their fight against Russia. NATO has declared that our country poses an immediate threat to the United States’ quest for total dominance and that China is a long-term strategic challenge. At the same time, the collective West, led by Washington, is sending an intimidating message to every other country, without exception, to the effect that anyone who dares to disobey may be next.
One of the consequences of the crusade that the West has declared against regimes it does not favour is that multilateral institutions are declining at an ever-increasing pace as the United States and its allies turn them into tools for realizing their own selfish interests. That approach is being embedded in the United Nations, the Human Rights Council, UNESCO and other multilateral associations. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has been virtually privatized. There are fierce attempts being made to undermine efforts to set up a mechanism within the Biological Weapons Convention to ensure the transparency of the hundreds of military biological programmes that the Pentagon has around the world, including along Russia’s borders and throughout Eurasia. Irrefutable evidence discovered on Ukrainian territory has shown that they are far from harmless.
We are seeing a huge policy aimed at privatizing the United Nations Secretariat and introducing a neo-liberal discourse into its work that ignores the cultural and civilizational diversity of today’s world. In that connection, as the Charter requires, we call for attention to be paid to ensuring the equitable geographic representation of Member States within the structures of the Secretariat so that no one single group of countries can dominate it. An intolerable situation has developed around Washington’s failure to meet its obligations, as the host country, under the Agreement between the United Nations and the United States of America regarding the Headquarters of the United Nations, to provide normal conditions for the participation of all Member States in the work of the United Nations. The Secretary-General has corresponding obligations under the Agreement, and any failure to act on them is unacceptable.
Various countries’ efforts to undermine the prerogatives of the Security Council are of course a matter of concern. There is no question that the Council, and the United Nations in general, should adapt to current realities. We see opportunities for making the work of the Security Council more democratic but only — and I want to stress this — by expanding the representation of the countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America. India and Brazil are particularly notable as key international players and worthy candidates for permanent membership in the Council, as long as Africa’s presence is enhanced at the same time.
Today it is more important than ever that Member States unambiguously reaffirm their clearly stated commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter as a first and essential step towards restoring their collective responsibility for the fate of humankind. That was the precise purpose of the establishment, in July 2021, of the Group of Friends in Defence of the Charter of the United Nations, which was co-founded by Russia and already includes a couple of dozen countries. The group aims to ensure strict compliance with the universal norms of international law as a counterweight to pernicious unilateral approaches. We urge everyone who shares that position to join. In that context, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, as well as the BRICS countries Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and ASEAN have considerable positive potential.
Despite their aggressive imposition of their understanding of democracy as a model for the social organization of all countries, our Western colleagues are categorically unwilling to be ruled by the norms of democracy in international affairs. The situation with Ukraine is a very recent example of that. Russia has expounded the basis for its position in detail for the past several years, and the West has expressed its disagreement with it. It should then be up to the other members of the international community to decide what position to take and whether to support one side or the other or remain neutral. That is usually what is done in democracies when opposing politicians make their case to try to win popular support. But the United States and its allies give no one the freedom to choose. They threaten and arm-twist anyone who dares to think independently. They use threats to force others to join sanctions against Russia. That has not worked very well for them, but it is obvious that these kinds of actions by the United States and its satellites are a far cry from democracy. They amount to a dictatorship, pure and simple, or at least an attempt to impose it.
We get a strong impression that Washington and its servant Europe are trying to preserve their vanishing hegemony through exclusively forbidden means. Illegal sanctions are routinely used instead of diplomatic methods against strong competitors, whether in economics, sports, the information space, cultural exchanges or general interactions among people. Indeed, the problems that representatives have encountered in obtaining visas for international events in New York, Geneva, Vienna and Paris also constitute attempts to eliminate competition and insulate multilateral discussions from alternative points of view.
I believe firmly in the importance of defending the United Nations and ridding it of anything confrontational or alien so that we can restore its reputation as a platform for honest discussions aimed at balancing the interests of all Member States. That is the approach that guides us in our efforts to promote our national initiatives within the United Nations.
It will be vital to achieve a comprehensive ban on the placement of weapons in outer space, which is the aim of the Russian-Chinese draft international treaty now under review in the Conference on Disarmament.
Defending cyberspace deserves special attention, including the negotiation of an agreement within the Open-ended Working Group on security of and in the use of information and communications technologies 2021-2025, as well as drafting a universal convention within the Special Committee on countering the use of information and communications technologies for criminal purposes. We will continue supporting the Office of Counter-Terrorism and the other counterterrorist entities within the United Nations. We will also continue to help promote dynamic ties between the United Nations and the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Eurasian Economic Union in order to coordinate our efforts across greater Eurasia.
Russia calls for stepping up efforts to settle regional conflicts. We believe we should prioritize overcoming the impasse in establishing an independent Palestinian State, restoring statehood in Iraq and Libya, which has been destroyed by NATO’s aggression, neutralizing the threats to Syria’s sovereignty, establishing a sustainable process of national reconciliation in Yemen and tackling NATO’s devastating legacy in Afghanistan. We are working to revive the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action for Iran’s nuclear programme in its original form, and to bring about a just and comprehensive resolution of the problems on the Korean peninsula. The multiple conflicts in Africa demand that we resist the temptation to play a geopolitical zero-sum game there and instead consolidate external players in support of the African Union’s initiatives. We are concerned about the situations in Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the United States and the EU are stubbornly seeking to undo the international legal framework set forth in Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and the Dayton Peace Agreement.
In times of change, people tend to rely on and find solace in the wisdom of predecessors who endured similarly challenging hardships. The former Secretary- General Dag Hammarskjold, recalling the horrors of the Second World War, said that “[t]he United Nations was not created in order to bring us to heaven, but in order to save us from hell.” Those words have never been more relevant. They call on all of us to assume our individual and collective responsibility to create the conditions needed to ensure that succeeding generations develop in safety and harmony. For that to happen, everyone will have to demonstrate political will. We are ready to work in good faith and strongly believe that the only way to ensure the stability of the world order is through a return to the roots of United Nations diplomacy on the basis of the key principle of true democracy, which is respect for the sovereign equality of States."

The world is in a state of turbulence, with intersecting crises growing in scale and severity, including climate change, food price inflation, conflict and uncontrolled migration. Those challenges all require multilateral cooperation and efforts. Yet the perception that the international system is no longer up to the task has only deepened, particularly where the interests of powerful members are at stake.
In the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, recent setbacks have served to highlight that the security situation is fundamentally no different than it was 20 years ago, when the largest and most expensive United Nations peacekeeping mission was first deployed. That has exposed neighbouring States, notably Rwanda, to cross-border attacks that are entirely preventable. There is an urgent need to find the political will to finally address the root causes of instability in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. The blame game does not solve the problems. Such challenges are not insurmountable, and solutions can be found. That would ultimately be much less costly in terms of both money and human lives.
Despite shortcomings, there are examples to demonstrate that international cooperation can successfully address the issues that matter to all of us. Global health is a case in point. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has helped save countless lives, in Africa and beyond, while also strengthening health systems. I hope that all countries will respond strongly and sustain their commitments at the seventh Global Fund replenishment meeting, to chaired by President Biden later today.
Africa is doing its part, but it must do more. For sustainability, external funding must go hand in hand with increased domestic financing for health. That is a priority, which the African Union is tracking on an annual basis, and which I am honoured to lead on behalf of the organization.
We are also working with partners to bring end- to-end vaccine manufacturing to our continent, notably through collaboration with BioNTech and strong support from the European Union. That is critical to increasing Africa’s resilience against future pandemics.
I commend the Secretary-General for convening the Transforming Education Summit earlier this week. The future of billions of children and young people across the world depends on overcoming the challenges of inclusion and quality of instruction, particularly as we recover from the pandemic.
Away from the headlines, the United Nations and other multilateral institutions retain the ability to set an agenda around which we can all rally. At the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kigali, leaders adopted an ambitious programme of action, including special instruments on living lands, urbanization and child-care protection and reform. We also agreed to prioritize public-private partnerships to create digital jobs for young people across the Commonwealth.
The future is digital, and transformation is happening now, as evidenced by the ongoing work of the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development and the Smart Africa secretariat. High- quality digital jobs are a practical response to the underlying drivers of irregular migration by closing the human-capital investment gap that separates high- and low-income countries. To ensure that the benefits are equally shared, we must continue to invest equitably in emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence.
In the area of peacebuilding and counter-terrorism, regional initiatives can complement the important work of the United Nations.
Regional and bilateral initiatives have been proved to make a big difference, whether in the Central African Republic or the successful engagement to contain violent extremism in northern Mozambique, conducted by Rwanda and the Southern African Development Community. If that approach were tried properly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as proposed by the Nairobi process, it would make a difference. However, to be sustainable, such efforts require consistent financial support from the international community.
A great deal is at stake, and time is not on our side. We cannot anticipate or prevent every crisis, but we can be better prepared to react quickly and effectively when needed, especially if we work together."
Saudi Arabia,SAU,Asia,"  33,703,000 ",47474,5.522999763,6.4,74.998,Cardiovascular Disease,Road Injuries,Neoplasm,2046,6.07,"  33,703,000 ",100.00,7.89,"At the outset, I should like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session. I wish him every success in his tasks.
I also thank Mr. Abdulla Shahid for his efforts during his presidency of the Assembly at its previous session. I commend the outstanding work of the Secretary-General to optimize the efficiency of the United Nations institutions to achieve the purposes of its Charter.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stresses its commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and its tireless support for the principles of international legitimacy aimed at maintaining international peace and security. It pledges to cooperate on the basis of mutual respect for the sovereignty of States, to resolve disputes through peaceful means and to abstain from threatening or using force. My country participated in establishing the United Nations and signing the San Francisco Charter, based on the teachings of our true Islamic religion and genuine Arab traditions of justice, charity, cooperation, peace and dialogue.
The Kingdom has always supported international multilateral action, in accordance with United Nations principles, to strengthen international cooperation and address the challenges facing our world. My country actively participates in all efforts to achieve a more
just and peaceful world and a promising future for our peoples and future generations.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, eager to achieve the goals and purposes of the United Nations and maintain international peace and security, reiterates its call for Security Council reform to make it fairer in representing today’s world, more effective in dealing with the changes and developments of the international community, and more efficient in addressing its common challenges.
With regard to the wars and conflicts being waged throughout the world, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stresses the need to heed the voice of reason and wisdom, and for dialogue, negotiations and peaceful solutions to end fighting, protect civilians and provide prospects for peace, security and development for all.
We support all international efforts capable of providing a political solution that will end the Russia- Ukraine crisis, stop the fighting and protect lives and property, while maintaining international and regional security stability. In the process of peacebuilding, overcoming challenges and achieving security, stability and prosperity with comprehensive economic development, we all need to pool our efforts, forge partnerships and promote cultural, civilizational and social exchange.
The Middle East region is in dire need of joint efforts to establish security and stability and ensure a better future that meets the aspirations of our peoples towards achieving development and prosperity. The Jeddah Security and Development Summit, in which leaders of the United States and nine Arab States participated, was an opportunity to confirm joint action for a better future for the region, its countries and peoples. We fully support the United Nations efforts to settle disputes peacefully; promote interdependence and integration regionally and internationally; strengthen cooperation based on the principles of the United Nations — respect for the sovereignty of States, non-interference in their internal affairs and respect for their independence, territorial integrity, values and cultures — while diversity enriches understanding and coexistence.
Security and stability in the Middle East swiftly require a just and comprehensive solution to the Palestinian question, pursuant to the resolutions of international legitimacy, the Arab Peace Initiative and the establishment of an independent Palestinian State within the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. We condemn all unilateral measures that would undermine the two-State solution and call for their immediate cessation.
With regard to Yemen, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reiterates its commitment to all efforts to maintain the truce and allow the Presidential Leadership Council to play its full role in establishing sustainable peace among Yemeni brethren, in accordance with the three terms of reference, including resolution 2216 (2015). We continue to play our leading role as the major supporter in meeting the humanitarian and development needs of our brothers in Yemen. In that context, we stress the need to lift all obstacles to the inflow of basic goods and the delivery of assistance, and to open the roads to Ta’iz, Yemen’s third largest city, which has been under siege since 2015.
As the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is keen to support security, stability and development in Iraq, we have reinforced our bilateral and collective cooperation with it, including the flow of electricity among the Kingdom, Iraq and the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
My country insists that the relevant Security Council resolutions be respected to ensure the unity, stability and Arab nature of Syria, and supports the efforts of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General to bring about a political solution to that conflict, in accordance with resolution 2254 (2015). We need to prevent a further outbreak of violence, respect the ceasefire agreements and ensure that humanitarian assistance can reach all Syrians in need unhindered.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also supports the sovereignty, security and stability of Lebanon, and stresses the importance of implementing comprehensive political and economic structural reform that will ensure the country’s success in overcoming its current political and economic crisis. Lebanon should not be a stepping stone for terrorists, drug trafficking or other criminal activities that would threaten regional peace and stability. It is essential that the Lebanese Government be able to extend its control over all Lebanese territory, including the implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions and the Taif Agreement.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia continues to deploy all efforts towards the convening of a dialogue among the Sudanese parties, wishing the Sudan and its people stability and prosperity. We also reiterate our support for arrangements to meet the water needs of Egypt and the Sudan.
We reiterate our full support the Libyan ceasefire agreement signed on 23 October 2020 and the Libyan calls for departure of all foreign troops, fighters and mercenaries without delay, pursuant to resolution 2570 (2021).
The Kingdom reiterates the importance of supporting the security of Afghanistan and the continued delivery of humanitarian assistance to that country, which must not become a base for terrorist operations or a breeding ground for terrorism.
International peace and security cannot be established through an arms race or the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). Instead, they will be secured through cooperation among States for achieving development and progress. We call on the international community to step up its efforts to prevent the proliferation of WMDs and ensure that the Middle East is free of such weapons. We call on Iran to fulfil its nuclear obligations expeditiously and fully cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency and take serious measures to build confidence with its neighbours and the international community.
Humankind is facing common challenges that threaten economic recovery following the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, most notably the security and availability of food and energy, supply chains, the environment and climate change challenges. Our capacity to overcome those challenges very much depends on our collective efforts, strengthened cooperation and a balanced, fair and united international response. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is aware of the importance of cooperation to addressing the challenges of climate change and the need to deal with its negative effects. In that regard, we attach particular importance to implementing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and supporting the gradual and responsible change towards diversified energy systems and sources that are more sustainable. Achieving these goals requires everyone’s participation, bearing in mind the different national and regional circumstances, countries’ differing socioeconomic situations, the world energy situation and the access of all to such energy.
In reaffirming our pioneering role in the area of sustainability, the Kingdom has launched the initiatives of the Green Saudi Arabia and the Green Middle East in support of national and regional efforts in that regard. We have announced ambitious goals to diversify sources of energy and optimize its production and consumption. We have also launched initiatives to protect the environment, promote sustainable forestation, reduce emissions by 278 million tons annually by 2030 and achieve zero carbon emissions by 2060 through the circular carbon reduction approach, in accordance with the Kingdom’s development plans and its diversified economy.
My country is also keen to support the world economy by contributing to ensuring balanced energy markets. We stress the importance of investing in fossil fuels and clean techniques in the coming two decades in order to meet the growing global demand and the interests of all consumers and producers, and to save the world from the negative consequences of unrealistic policies aimed at excluding the main sources of energy without considering the negative effects on world supply chains, inflation, high energy prices, increased unemployment rates and other security and socioeconomic effects.
The Kingdom, along with its international partners, works to mitigate the negative effects of armed conflicts and their painful repercussions on food security and 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, especially the goal to eradicate famine. In that regard, it is important to facilitate the export of grains and other foodstuffs, whose prices are skyrocketing, thereby threatening famine. My country contributes significantly to that issue. Our total contribution in food and agricultural assistance has now reached nearly $2.89 billion. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, along with our brothers in the region, has announced a $10-billion contribution to that end by coordinating and uniting the efforts of 10 national and regional development funds.
The international community has achieved successive successes in addressing terrorism and extremism. We must continue to work relentlessly to address and eradicate that scourge, which has no link to any race, religion or belief. We stress the importance for the international community to act firmly against States that support and sponsor terrorism and extremism and try to exploit their extremist ideology to expand and create chaos. The Kingdom is pursuing its efforts to promote construction and development in order to meet the aspirations of future generations and improve the quality of life, along with empowering women and youth to innovate and be open to dialogue, tolerance and coexistence.
The Kingdom attaches great importance to human rights, having drafted explicit texts to promote and protect them. My country has also announced legislation pertaining to reforms pursuant to our Saudi 2030 Vision with the aim of achieving better legal and judiciary systems, in accordance with better international practices and criteria aligned with the Kingdom’s commitments to international treaties and conventions. Pursuant to its ambitious vision for the future, my country has applied to host Expo 2030 under the theme: “The Era of Change: Leading the Planet to a Foresighted Tomorrow”. If we succeed in that candidacy, we wish to bring the exhibition closer in spirit to the idea for which it was created, namely, “Connecting Minds, Creating the Future”, with the aim of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. We thank those countries that have supported us in our candidacy.
In conclusion, we hope that our efforts will help convey our messages, values and principles to the world in a spirit of partnership and respect for a better future of humankind as a whole."
Senegal,SEN,Africa,"  15,854,000 ",2544,4.84499979,4.8,67.665,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Neonatal Disorder,978,6.17,"  11,156,292 ",70.37,4.84,"On behalf of the African Union, I would like to express my thanks to your predecessor, Mr. President, and to wish you every success in presiding over this session. I reiterate our support to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in carrying out his delicate mission in the service of Member States.
Since the previous session, the world has become more dangerous and uncertain, under the combined grip of global warming, security and health perils and the war in Ukraine. The theme of this session reflects the urgent need to act together to ease tensions, heal our planet, reduce persistent North-South inequalities and reinstate the importance of multilateralism.
The Security Council is called upon, first and foremost, to address all threats to international peace and security, including in Africa, in the same way. Terrorism, which is gaining ground on the continent, is not just an African matter. It is a global threat that falls under the primary responsibility of the Council, as guarantor of the collective security mechanism under the Charter of the United Nations. We therefore urge the Council to engage more with us in the fight against terrorism in Africa, with more appropriate mandates and more substantial resources.
Furthermore, the African Union once again calls for the lifting of foreign sanctions against Zimbabwe. Those harsh measures continue to fuel a sense of injustice against an entire people and to aggravate their suffering in these times of deep crisis.
In the Middle East, we reiterate the right of the Palestinian people to a viable State, living side by side in peace with the State of Israel, each within secure and internationally recognized borders.
We call for de-escalation and a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine with a view to achieving a negotiated solution in order to avoid the catastrophic risk of a potentially global conflict. Negotiation and discussion are our most effective weapons in the promotion of peace. I call for a high-level mediation mission, to which the African Union stands ready to contribute.
Nearly 80 years after the birth of the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions, it is time for a fairer, and more inclusive global governance that is better adapted to the realities of our time. It is time to overcome reluctance and deconstruct the narratives that persist in confining Africa to the margins of decision-making circles. It is time to do justice to Africa’s just and legitimate demand for Security Council reform, as reflected in the Ezulwini Consensus.
In the same vein, I recall our request for the African Union to be granted a seat in the Group of 20 (G-20) so that Africa can finally be represented where decisions that affect 1.4 billion Africans are being taken. I would like to extend my sincerest thanks to the partners who have already expressed their support and invite others to give favourable consideration to our candidacy.
With respect to economic and financial governance, I draw the attention of the General Assembly to the Financing for Sustainable Development Report 2022, produced by some 60 multilateral institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors and the Financial Stability Board. The report highlights shortcomings in the assessment processes of credit rating agencies and underlines the importance of transparent methodologies so as not to undermine confidence in ratings.
We are concerned that the perception of risk in Africa continues to be higher than the actual risk, which increases the cost of insurance premiums and undermines the competitiveness of our economies. That is why Africa is renewing its proposal to the
Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance to engage, in conjunction with the G-20, the IMF and the World Bank, in a constructive dialogue with the rating agencies on improving their working and assessment methods.
In the same spirit, in view of the unprecedented scale of the global economic crisis, the African Union reiterates its call for the partial reallocation of special drawing rights, which are critical for developing countries, and the implementation of the G-20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative. This unprecedented shock further destabilizes the weakest economies and makes their need for liquidity even more pressing in order to mitigate the effects of widespread inflation and to support the most vulnerable households and social strata, especially young people and women.
In addition, there is the need to address new and old health emergencies, including cancer, a silent killer that continues to claim millions of lives across the world. I call for general mobilization for the Rays of Hope campaign of the International Atomic Energy Agency in order to strengthen the capacities of Member States, particularly in Africa, in the fight against cancer using nuclear technologies, such as medical imaging, nuclear medicine and radiotherapy.
With the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Sharm El-Sheikh only a few weeks away, Africa reiterates its commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
At the same time, we hope to reach a consensus for a fair and equitable energy transition, as called for at the African Union-European Union Summit in February at the expanded session of the Group of Seven Summit in June and, recently, at the Africa Adaptation Finance Forum, in Rotterdam.
It is legitimate, fair and equitable that Africa, the continent that is the furthest behind in the industrialization process and is the least polluting, should exploit its available resources to provide basic energy, improve the competitiveness of its economy and achieve universal access to electricity. I recall that today more than 600 million Africans still live without electricity.
Let us also work towards the goal of mobilizing $100 billion per year to support developing countries’ adaptation efforts and to finance the African Adaptation Acceleration Programme under the auspices of the African Development Bank and the Global Center on Adaptation. Moreover, we see adaptation funding not as aid but as a contribution by industrialized countries to a global partnership of solidarity in return for efforts by developing countries to avoid the polluting patterns that have plunged the planet into the current climate emergency.
Beyond the current emergencies, I have come to convey the message of a continent that is committed to working with all its partners in a spirit of trusting dialogue and mutual respect. I have come to say that Africa has suffered enough from the burden of history and that it does not want to be the breeding ground for a new Cold War, but rather a centre of stability and opportunity open to all its partners on a mutually beneficial basis. I have come to say that we are not blind to an Africa faced with challenges where it is necessary to bring about peace and stability.
But I have also come to say that we also see Africa as a provider of solutions, with its 30 million square kilometres, its human resources, more than 60 per cent of the world’s arable land and its mineral, forest, water and energy wealth. We have an Africa of solutions, with Governments daily on the job, a dynamic youth who innovate, take the initiative and succeed and millions of men and women who work hard to feed, educate and care for their families and who invest, create wealth and generate jobs. This Africa of solutions wants to engage with all its partners in a reinvented relationship that transcends the prejudice that whoever is not with me is against me. We want a multilateralism that is open and respectful of our differences, because the United Nations system, born out of the ashes of war, can win the support of all only on the basis of shared ideals, not home-grown values established as universal norms. It is by working together, while respecting our differences, that we will restore strength and vitality to the raison d’etre of the United Nations, namely, to save present and future generations from the scourge of war, to advance the peaceful coexistence of peoples and to foster progress by creating better living conditions for all. I wish the seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly every success."
Sierra Leone,SLE,Africa,"  7,650,000 ",1070,4.47300005,4.3,54.309,Malaria,Cardiovascular Disease,Lower Respiratory Infection,521,6.81,"  2,004,368 ",26.20,4.85,"Let me commend the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for his sustained efforts in returning the General Assembly to its pre-pandemic work pace and for his message of hope. Let me also extend my congratulations to you, Mr. Korosi, on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly. I am gratefully optimistic about your leadership in these unprecedented times. I also commend Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for galvanizing the necessary multilateral support in search of solutions to meet the scale and urgency of current global challenges. His timely submission of his report entitled Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), which
speaks to strengthening global governance with a focus on a future agenda driven by multilateral solidarity and collective action, is also commendable. As our world wrestles with an unprecedented and volatile economic outlook resulting from the lingering effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and other crises, the theme of this session, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, is most appropriate and timely.
Our progress towards achieving the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 has been complicated by the repurposing of global development and investment finance, disruptions in production and supply chains, growing food and energy insecurity, general slowdowns in the economies of nations and the perennial adverse effects of climate change. I call on the global family to be intentional and fair about developing innovative development financing products that are free from the stringent restrictions and high transaction costs associated with concessionary loans. Multilateral financial institutions can de-risk investments that are critical to sustainable development. Aid must also be aligned with domestic development priorities.
The adverse effects of climate change know no borders. Global warming, unpredictable weather patterns, rising sea levels and land degradation are taking a profound toll on global food and water security. There are associated governance and stability costs. We are informed that Africa faces disproportionate risks and costs from climate change. We must therefore be consistent in meeting our commitments to all existing international frameworks for addressing climate change. Beyond the usual declarations, we must collaborate on and coordinate mitigation efforts, improve infrastructure for early-warning systems, invest more in improving the management of water resources, promote disaster-risk management and enhance the conservation and protection of natural habitats. There are also opportunities, especially in Africa, and Sierra Leone in particular, for just energy and rural agricultural transitions.
Fair and accessible multilateral climate financing can catalyse the global and country-specific measures and innovation necessary to build and support sustainable climate resilience. Green investing can support sustainable development. In such efforts, the roles and interests of women and young people must be central to climate investments. Sierra Leone is fully committed to concluding a treaty on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. Among other things, such a treaty must prioritize conservation measures, the fair and equitable sharing of monetary and non-monetary benefits, meaningful capacity development and the transfer of marine technology.
Human capital development is a critical driver of inclusive and sustainable economic development. Sierra Leone has increased domestic financing for education, provided teaching and learning materials and improved education policies and governance. More children and more girls, including pregnant girls, poorer and rural learners and learners with disabilities are now in school. But we can go beyond those access deficits. As co-Chair of the High-level Steering Committee on SDG 4 and a champion of the Transforming Education Summit, which just took place at the beginning of this seventy- seventh session of the Assembly, I urge for concerted global efforts to address the learning crisis. We can mobilize innovative financing models, underwrite universal access, especially for girls and learners with disabilities, promote technology in education, make greater investments in foundational literacy and numeracy, address water, sanitation, hygiene and other infrastructure deficits, support school feeding programmes, fund technical and vocational training and finance other needs across the full spectrum of the education sector. With close cooperation among States, we are confident that we can address the learning crisis in our time.
In order to address the global food crisis, which is disproportionately affecting the least developed countries, Sierra Leone joins the urgent call for action to escalate financing to support agriculture and irrigation and enhance food systems and nutrition for vulnerable populations and social protection for at-risk populations. Sierra Leone also associates itself with calls to ease global supply constraints, especially on fertilizers, rice and other agricultural commodities. Multilateral support for establishing agricultural development banks that will support private agricultural investments and agricultural added value chains will promote self- sufficiency and greater resilience in that sector.
The COVID-19 pandemic reminds us that equity, multilateral cooperation and a comprehensive global response are what we need to address health emergencies that have a potential to undermine global peace, security and development. Sierra Leone affirms
its commitment to global efforts aimed at exploring innovative and effective ways to enhance health security and pandemic preparedness, build capacities to respond to health emergencies and enhance greater resilience in health-care delivery.
Sierra Leone believes that multilateral support is urgently needed to complement national efforts aimed at reducing maternal and child mortality, preventing epidemics, tackling tropical and communicable diseases, building health-care infrastructure and the capacity of health-care personnel and strengthening primary health care. Efforts to increase the domestic financing of health care should be supported with increased multilateral financing and enhanced cooperation.
Sierra Leone remains wholly committed to the global agenda that puts women and girls at the centre of inclusive and sustainable development. We believe that we cannot deliver on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development without the achievement of gender equality and women’s empowerment. We must therefore garner multilateral support to achieve and sustain gender equality and the empowerment of women in our lifetime.
Sexual violence is a grave threat to justice and the fundamental rights of men, women and children throughout the world. In every corner of the globe, survivors of sexual assault are inhibited in holding perpetrators accountable and accessing empowering health, legal and economic remedies. In Sierra Leone, we have taken extensive legislative and administrative actions to address sexual and gender-based violence since my declaration of rape as a national emergency in 2019.
Last year, before this Assembly, I announced that I had directed the Permanent Mission of Sierra Leone to the United Nations to sponsor at the General Assembly a stand-alone draft resolution on access to justice for survivors of sexual violence (see A/76/PV.6). I called for global solidarity on the issue and for the United Nations to give all survivors of sexual violence the remedies that they deserve.
On 2 September, the General Assembly adopted by consensus the landmark resolution 76/304, entitled “International cooperation for access to justice, remedies and assistance for survivors of sexual violence”. I thank the Assembly. The General Assembly therefore affirmed the sincere and shared belief of the global community that sexual violence is condemnable, and that Member States must take effective action to address it, as well as to provide access to timely and unimpeded justice through national legislation for victims and survivors.
As the global community, we signalled our resolve to address that scourge. We must now do all that we can to implement access to justice and other remedies to ensure dignity for all survivors of sexual violence.
Small States make up the majority of the States Members of the United Nations, and they are the strongest advocates for the rules-based international system that underpins the work of the United Nations. Indeed, small States have served as key drafters, negotiators and thought leaders on a variety of international issues. They have diligently done that through transparency of purpose and coalition-building across the board.
In that connection, Sierra Leone proposes further pursuing such values in the Security Council. I count on the invaluable and resounding support of this organ for Sierra Leone’s bid for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the term from 2024 to 2025, with elections to be held in June 2023.
My Government reaffirms its commitment to the relevant provision of the Charter of the United Nations and the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, as contained in resolution 1514 (XV). We join the call on all parties engaged in the dialogue on decolonization to continue to demonstrate good faith and a firm commitment to the conclusive and durable resolution of all sovereignty disputes.
As the Coordinator of the African Union Committee of Ten Heads of State and Government on reform of the Security Council, I am pleased to note the commendable progress that has been achieved in the intergovernmental negotiations on the reform of the Security Council. We believe that the progress made during the seventy-sixth session of the General Assembly is underpinned by the Assembly’s acknowledgement of the wider recognition and broader support by Member States for the legitimate aspiration of African countries to play their rightful role on the global stage.
As Africa continues to advocate and canvass support for the African Common Position, as espoused in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, I urge Member States to continue to demonstrate their renewed commitment and political will to correct
the historical injustice done to Africa by supporting the reform of the Security Council so as to make it a more inclusive, democratic, transparent, accountable, legitimate and efficient global organ, which properly reflects and adequately addresses the geopolitical realities of our present and future world. Sierra Leone is committed to engaging constructively within the multilateral rules-based order of the United Nations. Only through global cooperation can we engender and implement transformative solutions to global challenges."
Singapore,SGP,Asia,"  5,758,000 ",67180,2.023999929,6.4,83.458,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Lower Respiratory Infection,650,11.29,"  5,758,000 ",100.00,12.81,"Let me first congratulate Your Excellency, Mr. Csaba Korosi, on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session. I also commend my good friend, His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for his stalwart leadership of the seventy-sixth session during a most challenging year.
This session of the General Assembly is taking place in the shadow of multiple concurrent crises. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine flagrantly violates international law and the Charter of the United Nations and undermines the rules-based order. We are also deeply concerned about the potential annexation of more Ukrainian territory. The multilateral system, which has contributed greatly to global peace and security, is now being severely tested. At the same time, super-Power rivalry continues to sharpen. As we have seen in theatres from Europe to Asia this year, the risks of accident, miscalculation, confrontation and even outright conflict have escalated. The prospects for international cooperation have weakened considerably and the temptation to resort to unilateralism has become even stronger.
But the need for concerted global cooperation has never been greater or more urgent, given the range of transnational challenges that all of us are confronting today. Our recovery from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remains uneven and fragile. In fact, the risk of a future and even more deadly pandemic has risen. The global economy is entering a period of higher and prolonged inflation, and we are seeing higher interest rates all over the world. Energy prices have soared, and it will become even harder to generate the resources that all of us need to address those long-term problems. Societies everywhere will have to grapple with greater internal division, disruption and polarization. Without that sense of cohesion, unity, trust or even an ability to agree on facts, the will and unity needed for societies to confront those existential challenges will be undermined severely.
The climate crisis is a clear and present threat. Our global commons, including water and biodiversity, are also deteriorating rapidly. Our global food supply is at risk. To make things worse, all those threats and crises are occurring concurrently, interacting with and compounding each other in a vicious circle. For instance, the Secretary-General has spoken of a triple crisis of food, fuel and finance. The impact of all those simultaneous crises on ordinary people and our livelihoods has been severe, all the more so in developing countries. We see this in the devastating impact of the floods in Pakistan and in parts of Africa.
The post-Second World War era of relative stability and prosperity has, unfortunately, come to an end. A new world order is being born and, as any obstetrician will tell you, the moment of delivery is actually the most dangerous. Will we have a more divided, less prosperous and less peaceful world? Or can we instead strengthen multilateralism and the United Nations to deal with the challenges of the future, uphold and strengthen the rules-based international system, and jointly harness the opportunities offered by new technologies: including digital technology, synthetic biology, customized health care and , of course, renewable energy? If we can do that, we can create a new era of peace and prosperity for everyone.
Singapore believes that the only way forward is to uphold the inclusive and rules-based multilateral system that has underwritten peace and progress for all of us since the Second World War. That is also why we worked with a cross-regional group of countries to establish the Forum of Small States (FOSS) in 1992. We started small, with only 16 countries. This year, we celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of FOSS. We now have 108 countries — a majority at the United Nations. We are all proud members. FOSS has always been a champion of the United Nations and rules-based multilateralism. It gives us a collective stake and a voice in the global commons, a means to safeguard our interests, and a system where we have sovereign equality and disputes can be settled peacefully, in accordance with international law.
Indeed, the profound importance of multilateralism and international law is precisely why Singapore has condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The security and even the existence of Singapore — and indeed many other countries, especially small States — depend on the international community upholding the fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. If we do not protect these principles, there is no basis for countries, big and small, to cooperate on an equal footing. Small States especially must not allow the world to regress to one where might is right.
While the rules-based multilateral system is not perfect, it is by far our best option in addressing transnational challenges and managing the global commons. This was exemplified by the pivotal adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) 40 years ago. It brought order and predictability to the governance of our oceans and provided a universal legal framework in which all States can work together.
The geopolitical reality today makes it harder to forge consensus on such a framework, but as our experience with COVID-19 has shown, multilateral cooperation is the only way forward. Ultimately, we share one planet. Despite our differences, our destinies are interwoven and no one is safe until all of us are safe. This applies to pandemics; it also applies to climate change, the conservation of the oceans and all our other shared challenges.
Singapore will do our part. We are honoured that Ambassador Rena Lee serves as the President of the Intergovernmental Conference on an international legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond areas of national jurisdiction, which is negotiating a treaty under UNCLOS on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ). We call on all delegations to expedite the conclusion of a robust and future-proof BBNJ treaty.
There is much more we can do to re-energize and transform the United Nations-based multilateral system towards new realities and challenges. I commend the leadership of the Secretary-General in putting forth a bold and ambitious Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) report to do so. Let me focus on just three areas in our global commons where there is an urgent need to build resilience:
First is climate change and food insecurity, global health and pandemic preparedness, and digital transformation and cybersecurity.
Climate change remains the most pressing challenge confronting humankind today, as we have seen from the more frequent occurrences of extreme weather events and the devastation that they have wrought the world over. We need a sustained and ambitious global response. The continued commitment of all countries to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Glasgow Climate Pact is absolutely critical. We also need to step up cooperation in the transition to net zero. That will, in fact, be the biggest socioeconomic transformation since the industrial revolution. Both will require considerable economic restructuring, technological breakthroughs, investments and behavioural changes. The United Nations-led multilateral system will be key in pulling everyone together to row in the same direction and not leave anyone behind.
Singapore, as a small, low-lying and alternative-energy disadvantaged island nation, is especially vulnerable to climate change and rising sea levels. Singapore’s impact on global emissions is infinitely small, but we take our climate action obligations very seriously. We have just raised our climate ambition to achieve net zero emissions by or around mid-century. A comprehensive strategy to green our economy is taking shape, and we will raise carbon taxes progressively from 2024.
We will do our part to build a comprehensive green finance ecosystem and facilitate the regional journey to net zero. We are supporting industry efforts to build the infrastructure for a voluntary carbon credit market in Asia. We are also building capabilities in environmental risk management in the financial sector and providing grants to defray the costs of green and sustainability- linked loans and bonds.
An adjacent issue is food insecurity. Climate change, the pandemic and the war in Ukraine have all exacerbated the threat to our food security. According to a United Nations report, as many as 828 million people were affected by hunger last year; that is 46 million more than in 2020 and 150 million more than in 2019. We must reverse this negative trend. First, we need to ensure that food supply chains remain open and operate smoothly. Secondly, we must pursue innovation and leverage technology to adapt to new challenges — for example, working together to develop climate-resilient food systems, while developing the necessary precautions on food safety. There is much scope for multilateral cooperation on capacity-building and the development of global norms and standards.
Next, it is essential to build a more robust global health architecture to protect our future generations. After COVID-19, there will be other pandemics and major health emergencies. In my view, COVID-19 was perhaps a dress rehearsal for a worse pandemic to come. We must be better prepared to predict,
prevent, detect, assess and respond to pandemics in a coordinated and effective fashion in the future. We have a collective responsibility to rectify the longstanding underinvestment in pandemic preparedness, amongst other global public goods.
Singapore has supported multilateral initiatives to strengthen the global health security system. We will continue to support the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility, and we have contributed to the establishment of a financial intermediary fund for pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, hosted by the World Bank.
Lastly, we must enhance international cooperation to harness the opportunities of the digital revolution. Digital transformation does not take place in a vacuum. It must be navigated in the context of intersecting issues: geopolitical tensions, technological bifurcation, cybersecurity threats and the digital divide. The world has made significant progress in development by operating on a single, shared technology stack. Interconnectedness and interoperability brought us together, lowered costs and spurred innovation, competition and the cross-fertilisation of ideas.
But if we fractured our world and our technology stack, all that good work and the speed of progress and innovation will slow significantly. We need an open and inclusive global framework to harness and optimize the opportunities of digital transformation, while effectively addressing its challenges. A zero- sum, exclusionary and bifurcated approach benefits no one. An erosion of trust and an atmosphere of confrontation will only breed more cyberthreats and malicious cyberactivities. We must also ensure that all States, particularly small States, developing and least developed countries benefit from the digital revolution and are not left further behind.
Singapore fully supports the Secretary-General’s proposal for a global digital compact, which has received strong support from Member States. We are honoured that Ambassador Burhan Gafoor serves as Chair of the Open-Ended Working Group on security of and in the use of information and communications technologies. The consensus adoption of the Working Group’s first annual progress report in July was a welcome sign that multilateralism is alive and well and can still deliver meaningful progress on the global commons, even in these difficult times.
In conclusion, this is a moment when multilateralism must be defended and fortified. Our responses to these myriad opportunities and challenges must remain rooted in the foundational tenets of multilateralism, especially including adherence to the United Nations Charter and international law. I remain an optimist in these difficult times and believe that we are actually on the cusp of an era of profound technological breakthroughs, one that will equip humankind with unimaginably powerful new tools.
It is in the world’s interest and in our own long-term national interests to set aside our differences, address the challenges of the global commons and harvest the emerging opportunities provided by new technologies. Ultimately, as Member States, we have as much responsibility to each other and to our citizens to work together and to improve, adapt and strengthen the multilateral system that we have so painstakingly built over the past 77 years, so that our people — all people — can lead better, more secure, more peaceful and happier lives."
Slovakia,SVK,Europe,"  5,453,000 ",26713,8.130000114,6.2,77.388,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,660,12.10,"  5,453,000 ",100.00,9.80,"The Organization has a clear purpose, as spelled out in Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations, to maintain international peace and security, to develop friendly relations among nations, and to achieve international cooperation. Today, most Member States would probably agree that we are still far from achieving that goal. But that does not mean we should not try.
Each and every Member of the United Nations has a responsibility to protect peace. In this, the permanent members of the Security Council have a special duty. Instead, today we see one of the five permanent members openly denying the right of another United Nations Member, Ukraine, to exist as an independent State. Those who break the rules themselves have no authority to set rules for others through the power of veto. The wrongs of Russia’s aggression could not be clearer. One hundred forty-one countries deplored Moscow’s war against Ukraine in General Assembly resolution ES-11/1. No veto in the Security Council can change the fundamental truth that today, rather than protecting global peace, Russia is doing everything to undo it.
Moscow’s aggression has inflicted harm on the entire world. Thousands of innocent Ukrainian civilians have been killed. Millions have had to leave their homes, triggering one of the largest refugee crises in Europe’s history. Fifty million people are on the brink of starvation in Africa and Asia. Russia’s blockage of Ukraine’s ports and confiscation of its harvest have made the already grave global food crisis even worse.
We welcome the deal mediated by Secretary- General Guterres and Tiirkiye and we call on Russia to fully unblock all Ukraine’s ports. Otherwise, the world will continue to suffer. The democratic world and all of us must be a voice for Ukraine — the voice that will not be silent and that will continue to testify about Russia’s crimes in Ukraine. We must be the voice that will remember and that will act so that no one is ever allowed to commit such atrocities again.
Vladimir Putin hoped to conquer Ukraine and scare the rest of us. In that goal he has failed, as Ukraine’s recent successes on the battlefield demonstrate. We will rebuild peace. To do so, we must learn from our past mistakes. This is not the first time we have seen aggression in Europe. Russia has occupied parts of
Georgia since 2008 and parts of Ukraine since 2014. Our response to those actions was incomplete. Concerns about our own comfort weakened our resolve. The tepid sanctions we imposed failed to discourage Russia from trying again. Our weakness encouraged more aggression. We must not repeat the same mistake again. The flouting of rules is poisoning global security, and it must not be allowed to stand.
More than 50 countries, including all members of the European Union, have already imposed tough sanctions on Russia. Slovakia is Ukraine’s direct neighbour. Our own security is impacted by this war. We are neither the biggest nor the richest country in the world. We have long been dependent on Russia’s energy supplies. But we chose the protection of our fundamental rights. We have imposed sanctions on Russia and are supporting Ukraine, including through military aid, because Ukraine’s fight is just and defensive, and in line with international law. I invite all Member States to join. We should all help Ukraine politically, militarily and financially because that is the only way we can restore peace.
The war in Ukraine is not the only crisis exposing the gap between the rules and commitments we have agreed on and their practical realization. In November, we will hold the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27) in Egypt. But our actions lag dangerously behind our words. Our greenhouse gas emissions are not falling fast enough. How much more scorched Earth, how many millions more climate refugees, how many flood victims will it take to convince us that ignoring our commitments is no longer an option? We are desperately behind in cutting our emissions. Worse, we hear voices arguing that the climate crisis must wait because of increasing energy prices. That would be a grave mistake. Yes, the price increases are painful, and we must help those who risk losing access to energy, but we must not lose sight of the bigger picture.
We are talking about the rising prices of commodities that we must phase out anyway to stop the planet’s warming. Rather than bring back subsidies for coal or gas, we must transition away from them. Renewable energy is less dependent on those who are trying to use gas or oil as an energy weapon. And it is cheaper. Despite the current energy crisis, Slovakia will stop using coal as a source of energy next year. We are investing in renewables and launching a retrofitting programme for buildings to boost energy efficiency because the cheapest energy is the one you do not use. We can only do this together, globally and in solidarity with each other. We need all big economies to join and help those who need it. At this year’s COP27, we will need a significant increase of funds for lower- and middle-income countries. Many of them contribute very little to our planet’s heating but suffer the most from its consequences.
As the world community, we have put short-term comfort over lasting solutions when it comes to two crises: that of international peace and order, and that of our climate. But there is a third crisis of relativization of values, facts and expertise, as well as a decrease of trust in democratic institutions. We are facing an epidemic of lies, propaganda and disinformation. It is hardly new, but thanks to the rise of social media, it is more powerful. If algorithms favour hatred over truth or nonsense over science, and if they appeal to our instincts rather than the greater good, what hope is there for global understanding or for the sort of cooperation that the United Nations was created to advance? Democracies are tolerant by default, but they die if they start tolerating intolerance.
Along with the rest of the European Union, Slovakia leads the way for an effective and democratic regulation of major social platforms and online media. Online space should be guided by the same democratic rules that apply offline. We welcome United Nations initiatives for rules for State behaviour in cyberspace. The efforts towards a so-called Digital Geneva Convention are justified and needed.
The crises I mention have a disproportionate impact on women and girls. That plays out in higher rates of gender-based and domestic violence, greater economic insecurity and poverty or worse access to education and health care. However, I am not here to portray women as victims. I am here to call on all of them to step up their engagement in public affairs. Women are agents of change. The world has a collective responsibility to support them because we are already seeing the consequences of a world that is run without taking their unique and diverse experience into proper account.
Time has not been very favourable to the ideas that built and sustain the Organization. The peace we should safeguard is fraying. The international cooperation we should foster has not prevented a climate catastrophe. And the spirit of shared global commons that the United
Nations embodies is under attack from extremists, their voice multiplied by new technologies. Half measures are not enough to cope with those challenges. We have tried that before. It is time for action and for clarity.
We, the Members of the United Nations, need to clearly side with victim over aggressor. We must choose the international rules-based order over the power of the gun. We must urgently deliver on our climate goals and find working rules for social media platforms to protect the fabric of our societies and the international order. Sure, we can delay and compromise. But again, history teaches us that passivity and ignorance never solve crises; they only delay the moment of reckoning. And since obeying even the smallest of rules matters, let me finish here to respect the agreed time limit."
Slovenia,SVN,Europe,"  2,078,000 ",28761,6.559999943,6.2,81.172,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,411,19.78,"  2,078,000 ",100.00,11.37,"I was born after the Second World War. All my life the cry “Never again!” has echoed around the world, especially in Europe. With the exception of the war in the Balkans, even the major geopolitical changes in Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall have been peaceful. That has made an important contribution to building hope for lasting peace.
That hope has been thoroughly shaken by the Russian aggression against Ukraine. Will that make us stop believing in the possibility of lasting peace? I think it will not. We must not leave our children in fear of war. For the sake of their secure future, we have a duty to do whatever we can to ensure that the precious
hope for a lasting peace returns to our hearts. After all, it was with that hope and our shared responsibility that the United Nations was founded.
The United Nations has set very clear rules of engagement to which all Members have committed themselves, including a commitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes, cooperation and respect for fundamental human dignity.
I wish to speak about peace, climate change and multilateralism today.
First, with regard to peace and security, the Russian Federation’s decision to conduct a military attack on Ukraine has shaken those rules, as have many other armed conflicts in different parts of the world. The Russian aggression has put international security at risk.
Yesterday’s announcement by President Putin that a referendum will be held in parts of Ukraine is a continuation of aggression and is in breach of international law. I especially condemn his words about the possible use of nuclear weapons.
The war is threatening the already fragile stability of the Western Balkans. It has also threatened international food and energy security. I commend the Secretary-General for his engagement, and Tiirkiye for its support in reaching the Black Sea Grain Initiative.
Peace, as I just said, is not just the absence of war. In peace, leaders should strengthen and nurture good relations with other countries. It is our obligation to resolve outstanding issues in a spirit of compromise and mutual understanding. Only in that way will we reduce the chances that old grievances and historical traumas will re-emerge.
I am grateful to many here for the opportunity to build good relations together for the benefit and wellbeing of our countries and the wider international community. Fostering good relations and building trust within and among societies is the most effective means of preventing armed conflicts.
Secondly, we need more cooperation for a better future. Nurturing and strengthening good relations among countries is also necessary to more efficiently address the challenges of our times, of which climate change is one of the most pressing. Our common task is to preserve the planet for future generations. What we need is more efficient measures and more solidarity.
Slovenia pledges special support to Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific to assist them in their efforts against biodiversity loss, water stress and climate damage.
We are contributing to the Least Developed Countries Fund of the Global Environment Facility.
Having initiated the Green Group, Slovenia is working with like-minded countries on the promotion of green policies.
We are deeply grateful to the General Assembly for the historic universal recognition of the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment. Slovenia was one of its original proponents, along with Costa Rica, Maldives, Morocco and Switzerland. That was a much-needed boost for multilateralism, but we can and should do more.
The upcoming United Nations conferences on climate change, biodiversity and water are an excellent opportunity to commit ourselves to do more and do better.
I wish to thank the Secretary-General for issuing his report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982). We support the proposed holding of a second world social summit in 2025 and expect it to address the challenges of structural inequalities.
There is no security and development without respect for human dignity. In all our efforts, we should lead with a rights-based approach. We should be attentive to all signs of human rights regression and should act accordingly.
Thirdly and finally, with regard to strengthening multilateralism and candidatures for the Security Council, the Charter of the United Nations is fundamental to our international system. A rules-based order is a sine qua non for maintaining peace and security, a just and balanced international system. Slovenia has proved itself a reliable and trustworthy member of the United Nations family and an honest broker. We are engaged in a genuine dialogue and a constant search for creative and good solutions to our common challenges. We are part of peacemaking and stabilization efforts that include humanitarian demining, rehabilitation and saving the lives of civilians all around the globe. We actively participate in efforts to strengthen the legal framework and respect for international law, including efforts to end impunity. We are building trust to secure
a better future. Slovenia has no enemies, but only friends all around the globe.
My country is well placed to become a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the term 2024 to 2025. We will strive unwaveringly for peace, justice, mutual understanding and reconciliation, both within and among societies, as well as for respect for ethnic, national and religious diversity and the promotion of sustainable development and solidarity. That is Slovenia’s task, and it is our common task."
South Africa,ZAF,Africa,"  57,793,000 ",11949,27.32999992,4.9,63.857,HIV/AIDS,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,13774,23.83,"  48,768,933 ",84.39,5.60,"Allow me to join all speakers before me in congratulating the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session on his election and in wishing him well in his role. I also thank the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session for his excellent leadership. Finally, I thank Secretary-General Guterres and the Deputy Secretary-General for their ongoing leadership of our multilateral Organization.
We meet at a time when the United Nations family is facing its greatest tests. The States Members of the United Nations have to work with the Organization to develop effective responses to the current challenges. As the theme of the General Assembly indicates, those challenges are diverse, immense, yet interconnected, and no country can respond alone. Some have referred to this moment as a key turning point in history. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war strongly influence those attitudes today. However, for South Africa, the real inflection point will be a world attending fully to the needs of the marginalized and the forgotten. Our greatest global challenges are poverty, inequality joblessness and a feeling of being entirely ignored and excluded. Acting on the 2021 Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) vision of the Secretary-General should become the major objective of this time — because addressing poverty and underdevelopment will, in our view, be the beginnings of the real inflection point in human history.
The Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its human rights protocols all commit us to protecting all people without distinction of any kind. We must acknowledge that we face theses crises today because we have not always upheld those foundational principles consistently and fairly. We believe that international law matters when this one is affected, but does not matter when this other one is affected. That does not help to uphold international law.
We have learned a great deal from the COVID-19 pandemic. It has provided us with a road map on what
we should do as the global community and what we should not do in order to address global challenges. We need to use the lessons learned from the pandemic effectively. There were some noble initiatives, such as the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A), co-chaired by President Ramaphosa of South Africa, the African Union champion for the COVID-19 response, as well as the Prime Minister of Norway. The ACT-A initiative laid the basis for a fairer distribution of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. We would like today to thank all of the countries that have acted on their financial commitment to the ACT-A initiative.
Global solidarity is also required if we are to meet other pressing challenges, such as energy and food insecurity, climate change and the devastation caused by conflicts, including the existential threat of nuclear weapons.
Up to now, instead of working collectively to address those challenges, we have grown further apart as geopolitical tensions and mistrust permeate our relations. We should, however, move forward in solidarity, united in efforts to address our common global challenges to ensure sustainable peace and development.
One of the tasks we must successfully implement in order to ensure developing countries are not left behind when treatments are available is to create and support research and innovation capacity in Africa and other parts of the world for vaccine production, to invest in strengthened public-health systems and to produce thousands more qualified professional health workers. All of that requires sustainable investment in higher education research institutions and in global research cooperation.
The mobilization of resources and capabilities to strengthen the pandemic response and the preparedness of all nations must be substantially increased. It would be a tragic indictment on all of us as leaders if future pandemics found the poorest as unprepared as many were for COVID-19.
We need to strengthen the global health architecture in order to ensure that we are better able to meet the challenges of new pandemics and other infectious diseases of concern. South Africa is proud to be part of the solution to those problems through the recent establishment of the first mRNA global-technology transfer hubs, which will contribute to the security of supply of life-saving medication for African countries and other developing countries.
South Africa, like many other developing countries, faces huge development challenges, including in our energy sector. We need to collectively address global energy shortages, including by deploying innovative solutions that are cheaper, cleaner and more accessible. Working with international partners, South Africa is developing its Just Energy Transition Plan in order to significantly reduce harmful emissions in our country. We are working on an expanded green economy intervention that is gaining significant momentum in our country.
I would like to commend the Secretary-General for focusing attention during this session of the General Assembly on transforming education. Education remains one of the most important drivers to end poverty and inequality, and we will work towards increasing access to education that is affordable as a country and as a continent. South Africa has no-fee schools at primary and secondary levels to allow the most vulnerable learners to access compulsory education. We also have a State bursary scheme for poor students who qualify for tertiary education. Over the years those measures have served to increase the enrolment of learners previously unable to access education. In the field of research and innovation, we believe we need more partnerships such as the Square Kilometre Array science infrastructure project hosted in South Africa and Australia, an international partnership that is one of the largest joint scientific endeavours in history. Partnerships of that nature must be encouraged in order to leverage scientific breakthroughs for development purposes.
We also believe that the multilateral trading system must be strengthened so that we can create an environment that is genuinely conducive to fair trade and provides opportunities for developing economies. If actionable steps such as those are not taken, developing countries will remain subject to an unbalanced global financial and trading system. Let us use this moment of renewal to reiterate our commitment to multilateralism as the only means for building a better world. The United Nations itself must of course be transformed so that it fulfils its role in a way that is cognizant of current global dynamics. It is unacceptable that 77 years after the establishment of the United Nations, five nations wield disproportionate decision-making power in the system as a whole. Its transformation must include more representative, transparent and accountable organs of
global governance. In order for our Organization to be effective, the General Assembly must be revitalized and the Security Council reformed. Nor will we have a credible Organization if it cannot hold persistent transgressors of the Charter accountable.
We believe we must act immediately to protect the environment and the world we live in, for ourselves and future generations. While Africa is the region least responsible for the climate crisis, it finds itself at the epicentre of its worst impacts. We should therefore emerge from the twenty-seventh Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 27), in Egypt, with an agreement that contains enhanced and balanced actions on adaptation, mitigation and financing. It must of course take into account our common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. In addition, we must agree at COP 27 on a mechanism for loss and change. In South Africa, our Cabinet has approved wide-ranging policies to ensure that we can meet our newly determined climate-change targets. We have established a climate finance task team to lead and coordinate negotiations with international partner groups in order to give effect to the Just Energy Transition Partnership, which seeks to address South Africa’s investment needs in infrastructure with the aim of facilitating our phase-down of coal so as to ensure that no one is left behind.
I do not need to reiterate that building a better world requires peace and stability. South Africa continues to believe that conflict resolution should not come through fuelling conflicts but through investing in efforts aimed at political dialogue. We should aspire to peace as a global public good. There have been no winners of the wars of the past seven decades. Instead, they have engendered strife, distrust among nations, divisions — as we are seeing this week — a perpetual misallocation of resources to weapons, and increased poverty and underdevelopment. Those are all features and effects of war.
While we work to address contemporary clashes, we should not ignore long-standing conflicts such as that of the people of Palestine, which has been on the United Nations agenda throughout the seven decades of the Organization’s existence. We cannot ignore the words of Daniel Levy, the former Israeli negotiator at the Oslo talks, who addressed the Security Council recently (see S/PV.9116) and referred to the increasingly weighty body of scholarly, legal and public opinion that considers Israel to be perpetrating apartheid in the territories under its control. Israel must be held accountable for its destructive actions, which have significantly impaired the possibility of a two-State solution. Similarly, we cannot ignore the decades-long struggle for self-determination of the people of Western Sahara. We must treat all conflicts across the globe with equal indignation, no matter the colour or creed of the people affected. South Africa also calls for an end to the embargo on Cuba, which continues to impede the right to development of its people. In the same vein, we call for an end to unilateral coercive measures against Zimbabwe, which have compounded the problems experienced by its people and have a detrimental effect on the broader Southern African region.
Our quest to build a better world will remain unfulfilled as long as people are still discriminated against on the basis of race, gender, sex, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture or language. We have a responsibility to make sure that every girl child receives an education and that every woman has an opportunity to work, study or start a business and has choice and control over her life and body. We must also ensure that more women speak at the General Assembly. We need to end the violence perpetrated against the most vulnerable, most often women and children. We have witnessed that women in conflict situations are particularly vulnerable, including women journalists. The murder of Shireen Abu Akleh and others is a stark reminder of the danger that women in conflict situations face. We must do all we can to protect them and make every effort to hold those who harm them accountable.
We must also strengthen the capacity of the African continent’s young people and draw on their voices. In that regard, we need to harness the demographic dividend by maximizing our investment in quality education as a means for addressing intergenerational poverty and ensuring inclusive economies.
Africa is home to more than 1.3 billion people. It is fast emerging from centuries of colonialism, occupation and exploitation, as well as willful neglect and underdevelopment. We now have an African Continental Free Trade Area agreement, and the countries of Africa are laying a firm foundation for a new era of trade, commerce and productivity. Our countries are establishing the conditions for the seamless flow of goods and services between African markets, as well as the growth of industry and the construction of the
roads, bridges, railway lines, ports and power stations that will support growth. As we continue our efforts to end war, conflict and insurgency in several parts of our continent and prevent unconstitutional seizures of power, we will continue to seek greater alignment between our agenda and that of the United Nations and our own body, the African Union.
To overcome all those acutely global challenges, we must agree to a common path out of an increasingly polarized world. A rules-based international system, predicated on international law and strict adherence to the provisions of the United Nations Charter, is essential. Such a system should safeguard the interests of all, not only powerful countries.
We acknowledge the efforts of the Secretary- General through his vision in Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), which we strongly support. We believe that he has provided us with options to put aside our differences, build trust and forge a world where future generations will prosper and thrive. That, and not a mandate of division and conflict, should be the mandate that we adopt."
South Korea,KOR,Asia,"  51,172,000 ",36151,3.730000019,5.8,82.846,Neoplasm,Cardiovascular Disease,Dementia,14636,28.60,"  51,172,000 ",100.00,11.68,"I offer my sincere congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly. I hope that under your leadership, Sir, the seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly will bring together the wisdom of each Member State so as to shape a better world. I also express my deepest respect to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his tireless devotion as he embarks on his second term.
Under the Charter of the United Nations, we are called upon to endeavour to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom and to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security. When the freedom of any individual in a nation comes under threat, members of the community must join hands to remove the threat and defend freedom. Likewise, when the freedom of any citizen or nation in the global community is in peril, it is the community of nations that must stand together in solidarity to defend that freedom.
Our modern history testifies to the process of our solidarity and unity in safeguarding freedom and pushing our civilization forward. Today, plagued by attempts to alter the status quo by force, nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and systemic violations of human rights, the global community is yet again witnessing the freedom and peace of its citizens put in jeopardy. Such threats to freedom and peace must be overcome through solidarity and fearless commitment to the framework of universal global norms consolidated over the years within the United Nations system.
The theme of the General Assembly session this year, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, encapsulates the gravity of the global crisis confronting us, which in turn underscores the solemn role of the United Nations. The first step in our journey to seek answers that will help us through these turbulent times begins with solidarity and deference to the universally accepted global norms, as well as the United Nations system established over past decades.
As humankind strives to defend freedom and build lasting peace, the role of the United Nations is indispensable. Genuine freedom is not just being free from shackles but having opportunities to live life to the fullest with dignity. Genuine peace is not an absence of war but the elimination of the conflict and enmity that hold back the shared progress of humankind. Genuine peace also entails building the foundation for greater prosperity. Genuine freedom and peace can turn into reality when we are free from disease and hunger, free from illiteracy and free from want of energy and culture. In that regard, the United Nations has been making great efforts through the Economic and Social Council and UNESCO, among others. However, the Organization is now urged to take on a broader role and responsibility. To tackle the challenges brought on by the pandemic, the United Nations must play a central role in bringing the community of nations together to decisively step up their support for countries with limited fiscal space and technical expertise. In pursuit of the global agenda for decarbonization, countries with leading green technologies must work to unsparingly share new and renewable energy technologies with other countries.
In the era of digital sophistication, one of the most urgent tasks for the global community and the United Nations is promoting global cooperation to narrow the digital divide, which exacerbates polarization among nations. Countries at the forefront of digital innovation must offer broader assistance for digital education, technology transfer and investment while the United Nations must redouble its efforts to mobilize support to that end.
The Republic of Korea, notwithstanding the recent fiscal consolidation, has scaled up support for those who
are in need with resources secured through expenditure restructuring. At home, we are offering more assistance to socially vulnerable groups. Abroad, we have increased our official development assistance budget. Just as broadening support for socially disadvantaged groups lays the groundwork for sustainable prosperity, support for nations of the world that are facing challenges will make global freedom and peace more sustainable.
As a responsible member of the international community, Korea is committed to shouldering its due responsibility and playing its role for the freedom of global citizens and the prosperity of the global community. Korea has accelerated research and development for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) therapeutics and vaccines, pledging $300 million toward the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator initiative and $30 million to the Financial Intermediary Funds of the World Bank, among others, thereby expanding its contributions to building a more robust global health architecture. We are also taking part in negotiations to reach a pandemic accord under the World Health Organization. To ensure a more effective response to future infectious disease outbreaks, Korea will host a ministerial meeting of the Global Health Security Agenda in Seoul this November. In addition, Korea will significantly increase its contribution to the Global Fund, joining forces with our partners in our fight against infectious diseases, including AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.
Turning to the issue of climate change, Korea will scale up its green official development assistance, help developing countries transition to a low-carbon future and share its innovative green technologies with all humankind. Over the years, Korea has been transferring and sharing its e-Government digital technology with developing countries and many others. The Korean Government is pushing forward with its plan to transform itself into a digital-platform Government. This is an ambitious initiative to substantially upgrade our democracy, public service and welfare through digital technology. We will continue to more widely share our advanced digital technology and data and will spare no effort in providing support and investing in education.
As we seek answers to the global crisis we are facing, the viability of the United Nations system and the universal global norms architecture is now being tested. The crisis confronting us will be resolved only when we stand firmly in solidarity to share the universal value of freedom and work together to uphold and spread our freedom.
In that vein, we must more firmly support the system of the United Nations, anchored in a spirit of freedom and solidarity, as well as the normative frameworks that have been universally recognized by the international community. Any attempt to turn away from the United Nations system and universal norms will divide the global community into blocs, further compounding the crisis and turmoil. We must more rigorously identify the nature and roots of the problems that lie before us. The international community must vigorously endeavour to share responsibility and join forces whenever necessary to resolve the challenges we face. Once again, I call on the citizens and leaders of the world to demonstrate resolute and enduring support for the United Nations system and universal global norms as we seek answers in this watershed moment.
Mr. Dang Hoang Giang (Viet Nam), Vice-President, took the Chair.
The very first mission of the United Nations, after its founding, was to approve the Republic of Korea as the sole, legitimate Government on the Korean peninsula, and to defend the freedom of my country by sending over United Nations forces during the Korean war. Thanks to such efforts by the United Nations, Korea was able to become what it is today. As such, the Republic of Korea will protect and expand the freedom of global citizens and, together with the United Nations, we will fulfil our responsibilities to promote peace and prosperity around the world."
Spain,ESP,Europe,"  46,693,000 ",31556,17.21999931,6.5,83.433,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,3609,7.73,"  46,693,000 ",100.00,10.51,"Rarely have the foundations of this institution been shaken as strongly as in the early hours of 24 February, when various cities throughout Ukraine felt the terror of Russian bombardments. More than six months later, we still witness the horror of an invasion that evokes times we believed we had left behind in Europe. Yesterday Putin continued his headlong rush with totally unacceptable statements.
From this rostrum and what it represents, I want to condemn in the strongest terms the announcement of the annexation referendums in the occupied territories of Donetsk, Luhansk and Kherson. Those false referendums constitute a further violation of international law by Vladimir Putin. Let me be clear: the results will never be recognized. We will continue to support what we have supported since the beginning of this dispute — the freedom, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. It is precisely now when we must act united in defence of the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in support of an attacked country, Ukraine.
This war seeks to rob the sovereign people of Ukraine of their legitimate right to exist in peace and freedom, and it has condemned the entire world — because it is a global crisis — to an era of uncertainty. And it has done so at the very moment when we were on the cusp of a well-deserved era of optimism, just after humankind had successfully set in motion the greatest large-scale scientific and humanitarian cooperation effort in its history in order to combat the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In these uncertain times, the economic and social consequences of the war are a threat to global prosperity, especially for the most vulnerable countries. The food crisis, which has been central to the debate of the General Assembly, is being compounded by an energy crisis provoked by an autocrat who will stop at nothing and utilize any and every instrument as a weapon of war in order to stay in power. The impact on prices, already rising due to the supply chain crisis last year, threatens to leave the world’s poorest even poorer.
It is not hard to understand why many people feel that they have had enough. Young people, born at the start of this new millennium, in particular represent a generation that, in addition to confronting this new crisis in their lives, is living under the very real threat of the climate emergency and its consequences for the world they will inherit.
Despite everything, however, I am certain that precisely where the danger lies, there too lies our salvation. That is why today I want to extend an unequivocal message of hope and confidence — hope in the capacity of the international community to overcome any adversity, and confidence in the strength of an institution such as the United Nations to rise up against challenges that know no borders.
Allow me to focus this reflection on five major challenges: the commitment to global health, the food crisis, the environmental transition, the digital transition and true and effective gender equality.
In matters of global health, it is essential that we learn from the lessons of our fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. On 9 November 2020, the whole world celebrated the news that the first vaccine against the virus was proving successful. Barely six weeks later, the first doses began to be administered. With those vaccines, not only did we begin to invert the trend of the pandemic, but we also reversed the pessimism of a world that had come to doubt whether things would ever return to normal.
The vaccine represents many things, but above all — in my view — it represents the triumph of the human spirit over adversity. I say that because, in just two years, the world has managed to develop not one or two, but 40 vaccines against COVID-19. Through the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility, more than 2 billion doses have been allocated for developing countries. Massive vaccination campaigns have enabled us to control the spread of the virus and return to normality in many countries. However, it is clear that much remains to be done and that many lessons must be drawn from the handling of the pandemic. The degree of inequality between countries with regard to access to the vaccine is, quite simply, insulting. That inequality, moreover, is to the detriment of humankind as a whole because a virus cannot be eradicated if its spread is not halted in each and every country around the globe.
Spain, which was very affected at the beginning of the pandemic due to our strong tourism sector, seeks to be part of the global solution to the enormous challenge that this pandemic and future pandemics represent. We will contribute €15 million to the Financial Intermediary Fund for Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness and Response, and we support the adoption of a legally binding international instrument to that end by the World Health Organization. In that way, we will strengthen a key organization in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our debt to science also demands that we take action in areas neglected during our race against the virus. We must step up efforts and promote scientific research in order to guarantee universal access to medical care and treatment. Over the next three years, Spain intends to allocate more than €237 million of its official development assistance funds to health-related issues, including €130 million for the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
The second major challenge I wish to share is the food crisis currently threatening millions of human beings. It is a complex problem that has the potential to deteriorate in 2023 if we do not act. The crisis has been exacerbated both by Russia’s blockade of grain exports from Ukraine and by selfish decisions to erect barriers to trade in agricultural products and fertilizers.
Two days ago, as co-sponsor of the Leaders Network Reinforcing Multilateralism Together, I co-chaired — together with the President of Senegal and Chairperson of the African Union, the President of the European Council and the United States Secretary of State — the Global Food Security Summit, on the current food crisis affecting the entire planet. It brought numerous world leaders from all regions, especially those most affected by this crisis, and we adopted a joint declaration renewing our commitment to deal with the crisis.
The meeting had a very clear purpose — to address this challenge and to seek solutions as a matter of urgency. At the meeting, I announced that Spain would lead by example by mobilizing €151 million in donations, and a further €85 million in loans over the next three years. That step is consistent with my country’s commitment to combating inequality and poverty the world over. That commitment has been made visible through our new law on cooperation, which anchors our promise to allocate 0.7 per cent of our gross national income to official development assistance by 2030.
The third major challenge I wish to discuss is related to the climate emergency and the need to advance the ecological transition with urgency and determination. It is clear that the current energy crisis is pushing us towards making a decisive commitment to far more sustainable energy models, reducing our dependencies and becoming more resilient. Diversifying, electrifying and decarbonizing our energy mix will be essential for
two reasons. First, we must prevent certain countries from using their resources as a weapon of war, as Putin’s regime is doing. Russia believes it has the right to blackmail the entire planet, helping to increase inflation and jeopardize the crucial recovery of the many economies that have suffered greatly due to the pandemic. Secondly, it is necessary because if we are to respond to climate change, which is the fundamental and increasingly obvious challenge facing our and future generations, we need to redouble our commitment to the transition to renewable energy.
I believe that the current situation is pushing us to even greater determination to deliver on our societies’ commitment to decarbonizing our economies. It is not a question of whether or not to do so but to do it fairly and at the speed demanded by the scientific certainty that time is running out. In that regard, Spain also wants to contribute to concrete solutions within the framework of the United Nations. Together with Senegal, we will support the creation of an international alliance for drought resilience to promote innovation, technology transfer and the mobilization of resources for countries exposed to this threat, which includes Spain. We will present that initiative in Egypt in November during the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, together with the secretariat of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and other interested countries.
I believe that the energy crisis is severely testing all European societies, including mine, essentially because of the harshness with which it is attacking the social majority of our societies, the middle and working classes. Every measure taken to reduce its impact should be based on the principle that this time the burdens and sacrifices should not fall on the shoulders of the great majority who were mistreated in previous crises, in particular the financial crisis. In that context, Spain has pushed for far-reaching regulatory reforms to reduce the impact of gas prices. But we are also aware, as the Secretary-General has said, that we must continue working — as we have been doing so for more than a year now — on vitally urgent reform of the electricity sector throughout the European Union. It is time to move forward by adjusting the sector to the current reality and distributing and limiting the costs and benefits of price increases in a fairer way. That is a commitment that my country will adhere to and uphold.
The fourth major challenge I want to mention relates to the digital transition and its impact on education and labour rights, now and in the future. On Monday, Spain participated in a session of the Transforming Education Summit dedicated to the digital transformation. We once again evoked the lessons learned during the pandemic and how technological solutions made it possible for the benefit of our children to bridge the gap of the in-person presence that was impossible at the time. Spain wants to play a leading role in that regard. We will be hosting the Giga Technology Centre, a United Nations programme for the digitalization of education to be established in the beautiful city of Barcelona, thanks to Spain’s collaboration with UNICEF and the International Telecommunication Union. Education is the path to a more educated, better informed, freer, more inclusive and more egalitarian society. If we want to continue advancing our human rights agenda, it is essential that we continue to support the right to education for all, but especially for girls. For it is at school where the agenda for gender equality and the empowerment of women — half of the world’s population — begins.
In that connection, my fifth and final point concerns the feminist agenda and real and effective equality between men and women. We live in times when stating the obvious sounds revolutionary. The global threats to women’s sexual and reproductive freedom are yet another example of the exasperatingly slow progress the world is making in ensuring full equality between men and women. Worse still, we are seeing that previous achievements are fragile, with women falling victim to an inexplicable regression in some advanced democracies in the twenty-first century. Spain will continue to be at the forefront on the matter, with the adoption of a new law guaranteeing sexual freedom and a future law on sexual and reproductive health to ensure public health care for women and all their needs across the entire country. In that area, I would also like to announce that Spain will lead by example and contribute €100 million over the next three years to organizations working for gender equality and with a focus on reproductive and sexual rights, including UN- Women. I believe it essential that we listen to women’s voices and remove every obstacle in their path so that they can occupy their rightful spaces in business, Government and peacebuilding.
I invite members to participate in a simple exercise and contrast pictures from 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Compare family photographs at home with the images that appeared then in the national media. For example, in my country, Spain, it is surprising and indeed amusing to see how our fashion, appearances and habits
have changed — including smoking indoors. All of that has changed. However, when we compare those images, we see one particularly intolerable difference, which is the presence of women in family photographs and their absence in public images reflecting the political or economic news of the day. We have come a long way towards achieving equality between women and men, but there is still a long way to go. Besides, not everything can be guaranteed, as we saw a few months ago in Afghanistan with the Taliban’s rise to power.
Last month, I had the privilege of visiting the Memory, Peace and Reconciliation Center in the Colombian capital of Bogota. I was able to observe first-hand the efforts of an entire people, and especially its women, to move forward by providing reparations to victims and building a society free of violence. Colombia is entering a new stage of hope in its efforts to continue building peace, and Spain will stand by its side, ready to support it. The countries of Latin America and the Caribbean have a fundamental role to play in the world and in the multilateral order, starting with the defence of democracy. However, we must be aware that the region also needs international support, including in the fight against drug trafficking. Spain is committed to supporting Latin America and the Caribbean and we will work to achieve greater rapprochement between the region and the European Union under our presidency of the Council of the European Union in the second half of next year. We want Europe to reaffirm its broad and strategic outlook towards Latin America and the Caribbean, aimed at achieving very simple objectives that make sense, such as revitalizing a fundamental alliance between the two regions. We must also pay greater attention to our own southern neighbourhood.
We are ready to take up the baton at a key moment for Europe. We seize it with enthusiasm and hope, aware of the challenges ahead and the responsibility it represents. We want the priorities I have just outlined to permeate and direct our action in the second half of 2023. The green transition and digitalization, as well as the social transition, will resolutely guide the path we wish to follow during our presidency of the Council of the European Union.
Europe is a project for stability, peace, freedom, democracy and harmony. It is a project for peace that we want to see projected into other parts of the world, starting with Ukraine. It is clear that we must continue to work to ensure that other areas, in addition to Ukraine, also regain stability. We are making progress in negotiations to reach a nuclear deal in Iran, in which I believe the European Union is playing a key role. However, we have recently seen how tensions in the East China Sea are threatening the status quo in a region that is key to humankind’s present and future. The importance of Asia in the field of global security was underlined at the NATO Summit in Madrid in June, which brought NATO’s Pacific partners together at the top level for the first time and endorsed a new strategic concept for the organization for the next 10 years. In Madrid, we welcomed two new full and democratic members, Sweden and Finland, and approved a new strategic concept for NATO that will guide the future of the alliance for the next few years. The concept makes a fine-tuned diagnosis of an increasingly complex strategic environment. It gives significant attention to the South and the Sahel in particular, a region affected by growing instability and increasing terrorism. We must focus on the serious risks in the area such as irregular migration flows and the threat of terrorism, which could be exacerbated by the conjunction of the food and energy crisis, the climate emergency and demographic trends.
We cannot carry over conflicts from the past century. For that reason, with regard to Western Sahara, an area of great importance to Spain, we support a mutually acceptable political solution within the framework of the Charter of the United Nations and in line with the relevant Security Council resolutions. In that regard, we consider the work of the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Western Sahara to be fundamental, and I want to assure him of the Spanish Government’s full support. My country will continue to support the Sahrawi population in refugee camps, as it has always done, in its capacity as the main international donor of humanitarian aid to those camps.
On the other hand, as I reported during last year’s general debate (see A/76/PV.9), on 31 December 2020, Spain and the United Kingdom reached a bilateral understanding on Gibraltar in the context of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union. We have been working very hard since then to ensure that this understanding serves to lay the foundations for the territory’s future relationship with the European Union, trusting that an agreement will be reached between the European Union and the United Kingdom in relation to Gibraltar as soon as possible. The agreement should fully respect United Nations doctrine on the territory, with which Spain is wholly aligned, as well as for my country’s legal position with regard to its sovereignty and jurisdiction. In any case, we hope to work for the
development of a prosperous social and economic area that encompasses the whole of Gibraltar and the Campo de Gibraltar as well.
In conclusion, I appealed at the beginning of my address to two sentiments — hope for the future and confidence in the multilateral order represented by the United Nations system. Two years ago, we feared we would never again see a world in which people could shake hands or hug or kiss one another. We came to believe that such acts of affection and courtesy would also fall victim to the pandemic. Today the world that seemed unattainable has been restored. It is a logic often repeated in history when societies arrive at a great crossroads. Yet hope always finds away. Sometimes with a push from science and knowledge, as in this case, and sometimes from a desire not to repeat the fatal mistakes of the past. I believe that humankind will always find a way to overcome the blows of fate and move forward. What makes the difference is how we deal with these crises and how we heal the wounds suffered along the way, while at the same time protecting those who are most vulnerable and most exposed.
We must be guided by the values and principles to which we all adhere as Member States of this noble and important Organization, in which Spain reaffirms its full confidence. We must persevere in our efforts to build a freer, more prosperous, fair, diverse and democratic world. In order to do so, it is essential to strengthen rules-based multilateralism and ultimately to guarantee peace — the most valuable asset we have."
Sri Lanka,LKA,Asia,"  21,229,000 ",11118,4.078999996,4.4,76.812,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Chronic Respiratory Disease,2977,14.02,"  21,229,000 ",100.00,8.46,"I am honoured to represent Sri Lanka at the seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly, which after two years brings together world leaders post-pandemic in this Hall in person.
Permit me the honour of congratulating His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi on being elected President of the General Assembly at its current session. Sri Lanka looks forward to working closely with him and his team in the year ahead.
May I also convey our appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid of Maldives for his excellent stewardship of the seventy-sixth session. As a close friend and neighbour of Maldives, we express particular appreciation for his presidency of hope, which gave us renewed optimism and vigour. Building on that, we move to the vision of our new President of finding solutions through solidarity, sustainability and science.
Seventy-seven years ago, when the battlefields of the Second World War had fallen silent but their horrors reverberated around the globe, a new world order emerged out of the remains of the old one. And that new world order was manifested by the Charter of the United Nations, developed by 50 nations at the San Francisco Conference. The United Nations is a table at which every State can sit down, a forum where everyone can be heard and where everyone is equally important. That is the concept of multilateralism, and it is a fundamental political principle of diplomacy. It is said that multilateral diplomacy is similar to gardening — you plant, you wait, you sow the seeds, you wait, you trim and you harvest at some point. In multilateralism, we talk to each other, we develop a relationship of trust and confidence and, if something were to come up, you have the base to work from.
The world is facing a multiplicity of complex, interlocking challenges. The far-reaching effects of the pandemic have been further exacerbated by the current global crises. Those vulnerabilities have been aggravated by the devastating consequences of what the Secretary-General has referred to as a “five-alarm global fire”, which has resulted, inter alia, in the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and rising pollution. We are, in addition, witnessing extreme weather patterns resulting in loss of life, property and habitat, involuntary human displacement and an accompanying food and energy crisis.
It is not difficult to imagine that these trends can lead to deepening inequalities, both within and among States. Developing countries and their economies are at extreme risk, with Governments facing debt default and financial collapse due to lack of access to adequate capital, while people face rising poverty, unemployment and hunger. As a consequence, nutrition levels, especially among children, are being affected and their education and intellectual advancement disrupted. Despite our best efforts, our collective ability to realize the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or even to sustain the gains already achieved is becoming increasingly difficult.
It is against that challenging global backdrop that significant changes have taken place in Sri Lanka since the last session of the General Assembly. The external and internal challenges we face provide an opportunity for implementing political, social and economic reforms that will lead to recovery and prosperity for our people. Sri Lanka believes that this is the moment to realize our collective vision for the future — an opportunity to build a more just, sustainable and prosperous future for all Sri Lankans, and to build back better. We look forward to the cooperation and support of the international community, including the United Nations, as we embark on that journey.
Following prolonged social unrest and protests in the country, President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his maiden speech in Parliament last month stated: “I will implement the social and political reforms requested by the nation”. Those measures include a review of the present procedures, the strengthening of the institutional framework of democratic governance and the adoption of urgent measures to restore long-term economic stability. We have understood that this will be possible only if we engage in strict adherence to fiscal discipline and far-reaching economic and institutional reforms.
We are committed to that process. It is envisaged that through the proposed legislative and constitutional amendments, democratic governance will be reinforced with independent oversight institutions and enhanced public scrutiny. Legal and administrative frameworks are being strengthened to ensure transparency, integrity, accountability and inclusivity in providing access to justice. A greater participation of women and youth will be ensured in this process.
We remain cognizant of and acutely sensitive to the events that have taken place in the recent past. The Government is extremely sensitive to the socioeconomic hardships faced by our people. We are pleased to have reached a staff-level understanding with the International Monetary Fund. We have put in place measures to protect the vulnerable segments of society and will endeavour to ensure that these economic reforms have a minimum impact on their lives. Our institutions and society have demonstrated remarkable resilience in the face of very difficult circumstances.
We unconditionally recognize the fact that one has a fundamental right to the freedom of expression, which we all treat as sacrosanct. However, it must also be appreciated that this freedom must fall within the constitutional order and be exercised having regard to one’s fundamental duty to express oneself within the confines of the law.
I am pleased to inform the Assembly that Sri Lanka’s nationwide strategy in containing the human health impact of the coronavirus disease has
been largely successful as a result of proactive and non-discriminatory measures by the Government and the effective delivery capabilities of our strong healthcare infrastructure. Our vaccination drive exceeded World Health Organization targets. However, as a developing country we were highly vulnerable to the economic fallout of the pandemic. The virus has opened a window to the future that we must exploit, highlighting the importance of multilateral cooperation through global health networks.
Permit me to briefly turn to the aspect of climate change. As Sri Lanka is a climate-vulnerable country, climate change has had the potential to adversely impact our socioeconomic progress, as well as food security and livelihoods. Sri Lanka has pledged to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and our updated nationally determined contributions (NDC), submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change last year with the aim of reducing emissions to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. We firmly believe that those commitments should not adversely impact the green economic development objectives. We also appreciate that meeting the NDC targets and executing the corresponding energy transition towards renewable and sustainable energy and energy efficiency measures will require significant climate financing.
Members will appreciate that we cannot do that alone. We believe that in tandem with our own efforts, the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases must fulfil their commitments and assist developing nations in adaptation and mitigation measures under a common but differentiated framework. We need to work towards a just, sustainable, resilient and inclusive recovery from the adverse impacts of climate change and the energy transition.
Turning to the ocean, members will appreciate that as an island nation, we are acutely concerned about and sensitive to the impact of pollution and climate change on the oceans. With rapidly growing pressure on land resources, the world is turning towards the oceans for sustenance, not only for food security but also as a source of raw materials for industries and energy. We are committed to the sustainable use of the oceans and its resources in consonance with SDG 14. In the General Assembly in May, we were pleased to have led a small but significant nature-based solution to mitigate the impact of climate change that led to the United Nations declaring 1 March as World Seagrass Day. Seagrasses are an important carbon sink and absorb significantly more carbon than tropical rain forests.
There is a likelihood that the world will not reach the scheduled milestones to achieve zero hunger by 2030. It is predicted that food and nutrition security will be at great risk. Sri Lanka is paying serious heed to those warning signs. Sri Lanka supports the sustainable transformation of agriculture to a modernized sector and encourages enhanced food production to ensure food security. Sri Lanka has initiated the national food security programme with the dual objectives of ensuring that no citizen should suffer for the want of food and no child should be a victim of malnutrition.
Adequate nutrition is a sine qua non and vital to ensuring that children of all socioeconomic backgrounds can enjoy good health. The provision of quality education and health care for all is at the core of Sri Lanka’s social protection policies and provided the foundation upon which Sri Lanka was able to mitigate the effects of the global learning crisis during the coronavirus disease pandemic. Rapid conversions to digital systems for the delivery of education threatened universal access, participation and survival in the education system, especially among children of low- income households. Sri Lanka aims to bridge the digital divide and ensure that no child will be left behind.
Despite severe challenges, we will endeavour to maintain the significant progress we have made towards achieving the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development. Our efforts have placed us in a leading position in the Asia-Pacific region for SDG data availability, thereby enhancing Sri Lanka’s capacity for evidence-informed policymaking for the SDGs in future. We recognize that investment in human capital is indispensable to the future of our country. It is no surprise that Sri Lanka is ranked high in the human development category, occupying rank 73 out of 191 countries globally, and is the highest in the region.
Having said that, we are nonetheless concerned that current challenges have disrupted progress. The Secretary-General has in, a serious warning, made reference to rescuing the Sustainable Development Goals. That warning has been followed by an observation by the United Nations Development Programme, that for the first time in 32 years, the Human Development Index has declined globally for two years consecutively.
Let me say a word about global security. Geopolitical tensions among nations have heightened,
creating insecurity and polarization among States. Agreed frameworks for arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament have become fragile. At the recently concluded tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which remains the centrepiece of the global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime, we were regrettably unable to arrive once again at a consensus outcome.
While we address contemporary challenges, we must not forget the lingering issue of Palestine. While restating Sri Lanka’s consistent and principled position that the Palestinian people have a legitimate and inalienable right to the natural resources in their territory and to statehood, we further recognize the legitimate security concerns of both the Palestinian and the Israeli peoples, and an urgent resolution of the matter, on the basis of United Nations resolutions on the attainment of the two-State solution, needs to be pursued immediately.
The absence of a regulatory supervisory regime concerning the use of new technologies in cyberspace and in artificial intelligence needs to be addressed urgently. Their ability to cause large-scale disruption, spread disinformation and undermine scientifically established findings is of real concern and a danger we all face. Sri Lanka, which is implementing the nation’s first information and cybersecurity strategy, has identified the importance of establishing a partnership- based approach to protecting cyberspace in order to confront multinational cyberthreats.
I must make a brief reference to the scourge of terrorism. Sri Lanka was a victim of terrorism for several decades. Terrorists’ choice of targets, methods of financing and radicalization, as well as the use of new technologies as weapons, have been constantly evolving. Legislative measures and law enforcement mechanisms must be put in place to counter radical ideologies leading to violent extremism and to curb the terrorists’ use and abuse of the internet and social media platforms. At the same time, it is necessary to develop the critical thinking capacity of youth, strengthen community bonds, foster a sense of civic responsibility, and build community resilience to mitigate the effects and influences of violent extremist ideology leading to terrorism.
As our contribution to maintaining international peace and security, Sri Lanka looks forward to enhancing our participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations with professional men and women to serve as peacekeepers. I take this opportunity to honour the thousands of men and women who, for decades, have helped countries navigate the difficult path from conflict to peace under the Blue Helmet. We have taken many measures to ensure that Sri Lankan peacekeepers, with a wealth of experience in counterterrorism and counter insurgency operations, are trained and equipped with theoretical and practical knowledge of all necessary functions of peacekeeping, including the promotion and protection of human rights.
This is indeed a watershed moment for the international community — a moment of great challenge and opportunity. The complex and interconnected crises that we face cannot be resolved by nations acting on their own. This is an opportunity to demonstrate global solidarity, diplomacy and collective efforts, leveraging the ideas and talents of all of our people and all segments of our society to find transformative solutions that leave no one behind. Multilateralism is a tool for diplomacy that rises above such challenges. Conflicts, disasters and crises will not stop at passport control. Multilateralism is not without its shortcomings, but undoubtedly it provides a solid framework for resolving contemporary challenges.
This, I would say, is the mission of the Assembly, and perhaps the singular reason for which it was established 77 years ago. And that perhaps is the reason why Sri Lanka and many others applied to be Members — to participate, to be visible, to be heard and to embellish the Organization with our own flavours, perspectives, history and knowledge, adding to this fine amalgam and growing from the common work discussions and disputes that we take issue with.
I wind up by citing the observations of one of our late Prime Ministers, who committed Sri Lanka to the way of a socialist democracy, to non-alignment and to an independent foreign policy based on friendship with all countries, irrespective of differing ideological and social systems, when he said:
“We have to build up a new society for ourselves; one, as I have said, which best suits the genius of our country. We should like to get some ideas and principles from this side, and some from the other, until a coherent form of society is made up that suits our people, in the context of a changing
world today. That is why we do not range ourselves on the side of this power bloc or that.”
Permit me to make the observation that the 193 nations represented here jointly share the responsibility to establish justice, maintain peace and ensure progress in a world that is in trouble as never before. We have a Charter and a formidable body of international law, inclusive of our supreme law of the Constitution of the Republic and other local statutes. We are acutely conscious of the fact that, notwithstanding all these sophistications, multipronged challenges remain. The Government of Sri Lanka is committed to overcoming these challenges.
It is to that commitment that Sri Lanka pledges itself today, in the sincere hope that we will exploit the crisis that is at hand, build back better, leaving no one behind, and rise to new horizons of freedom and progress."
Sweden,SWE,Europe,"  9,972,000 ",44371,6.71999979,7.4,82.654,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,1479,14.83,"  9,972,000 ",100.00,11.58,"Times of crisis require the best of us. When warnings sound, action must follow. Only then will development be sustainable and peace be maintained. Honest reflection on the gravity of the challenges must be followed by determined commitments to address them. That is what respecting the Charter of the United Nations means and what multilateralism is all about.
We are all aware of the immense tasks facing us. Almost 350 million people in more than 80 countries face acute food insecurity, trying to merely survive the day instead of making plans for tomorrow. Some 50 million people in 45 countries are on the brink of starvation. Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is halting, leaving millions of women, men and children behind. Extreme poverty is on the rise for the first time in two decades. The world is in the midst of an accelerating climate and environmental crisis, and the effects of the ongoing pandemic continue to afflict individuals and societies around the world.
A permanent member of the Security Council has launched an unprovoked, unjustified and illegal aggression against a neighbouring country. That was done in blatant disregard of its international obligations and the human suffering that extends far beyond the immediate war zone.
As Member States, we also know what is required of us. The General Assembly has come together to demand that Russia immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders. The General Assembly has reaffirmed Ukrainian sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.
Today Sweden reiterates that demand in the strongest possible terms, alongside other European Union (EU) member States, transatlantic partners and countries around the globe. The war in Ukraine must stop, and Russia’s troops must withdraw. Any fake referendums on Ukrainian territory would be illegal and will have no effect. Neither partial mobilization, the appalling use of nuclear threats nor any other escalation will deter us from supporting Ukraine. Humanitarian law and principles must be upheld, and Ukraine’s nuclear power plants must be protected from Russia’s illegal and reckless attacks. Accountability for the heinous crimes committed must be ensured. International law must be upheld, and decisions by United Nations entities must be respected.
Russia’s aggression has severely escalated the food security, energy and financial crises. Governments and societies already struggling to cope with the consequences of climate change, conflicts and the pandemic now face even more serious challenges. Because of the actions of one country, more than one and a half billion people in more than half of the States Members of the United Nations find themselves at greater risk of poverty, starvation and debt. In short, the global relief, recovery and resilience needs are immense. Sweden and the EU have scaled up our own contributions to meet them.
To save lives and alleviate suffering where needs are greatest, Sweden has increased its humanitarian assistance to a record high $950 million this year. We commend the efforts of the Secretary-General and the President of Tiirkiye on the Black Sea Grain Initiative. Under the Initiative, some 50,000 tons of wheat will, thanks partly to Swedish funding, soon leave the port of Odesa, bound for millions of women, men and children at risk of famine in Yemen. A significant part of Sweden’s ambitious aid budget has been directed to the United Nations as an investment in global peace, security and development and the multilateral system itself. Our actions are firmly anchored in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Peace, with the SDGs, and in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which are now more important than ever. It is time to raise our ambition and accelerate action to tackle climate change and biodiversity loss, or we will fail not only future generations but also our own.
At the international meeting Stockholm+50, held in June, countries came together to follow through on recommendations and actions. Sweden has spearheaded the climate transition through innovation and green investments and an ambitious increase in climate aid. Mounting evidence shows that climate change also leads to greater risks to peace and stability. A solid foundation for advancing climate security is in place at the United Nations and in regional organizations. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe took key decisions last year during the Swedish chairpersonship, and the EU is scaling up.
The nuclear threat is alarmingly present, and Russia’s actions lower the threshold in a way that increases the threat facing us all. In January, the leaders of all five nuclear-weapon States committed to the prevention of nuclear war and avoiding an arms race. They affirmed that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. Russia’s irresponsible actions and nuclear rhetoric since then severely undermine the credibility of its commitment to that pledge. It is also deeply troubling that Russia broke consensus on the draft outcome document of the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The countries of the Stockholm Initiative on Nuclear Disarmament have presented ideas in response to the Secretary-General’s call to bring disarmament and non-proliferation back to the top of the international agenda.
The world is in a gender-equality recession. Regrettably, we still cannot take for granted women’s rights and representation or the resources needed to ensure them. Violence against women and girls has increased. Access to safe and legal abortion has suffered major setbacks. And one year after the Taliban takeover, the situation for women and girls in Afghanistan has turned into a nightmare, in an unparalleled system of discrimination. At the same time, more and more States are acknowledging that a gender perspective is needed to meet global challenges.
As we gather for the first fully in-person General Assembly high-level week since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease, we must do everything in our power to prevent another pandemic. Sweden and the EU have made substantial contributions to global vaccination. Last year alone, Sweden committed more than $600 million to global health. The Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response has set out clear recommendations for action, and we should make use of them.
A year ago, the Secretary-General presented his blueprint for a modern multilateral system. Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) is an accelerator of the SDGs, a launch pad for a new agenda for peace and a way towards a more inclusive, modern and networked United Nations. It was us, the Member States, who called for the report — and as Member States we should do our collective best to act on it. The recent establishment of the Office of the Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth was a fitting first decision, because this is an agenda for the future. And the convening of the Transforming Education Summit earlier this week was another important step towards implementation. We look forward to similar progress on other recommendations, from investments in peacebuilding and strategic foresight to digitalization and a global economy that benefits all by being fair and open. We must keep up the momentum until we realize our ambitions at the Summit of the Future in 2024.
Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has caused the greatest refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War, aggravating the already serious global refugee situation. This military invasion of a country in our neighbourhood, in violation of the very same international law that has protected us all from aggression, has also fundamentally changed Sweden’s security environment. In response to the serious deterioration of the security situation, on 16 May the Swedish Government decided to apply for NATO membership. The decision has broad national support and was made following extensive consultations among our political parties. It was taken in tandem with Finland, and the decision is anchored in a firm belief that security is best built together with others.
When I signed our formal request for NATO membership, I noted the fundamental changes to our defence and security policy. But I also stressed the importance of the continuity of our ambitious global and multilateral foreign policy. That enduring global commitment is also reflected in the EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy. Sweden will hold the presidency of the Council of the European Union for the first half of 2023. We look forward to further strengthening the EU’s global role and deepening cooperation with partners around the world. We will work to protect, promote and defend democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law. And we
will reinforce the already solid EU-United Nations relationship in seeking multilateral solutions. We lend our full support to Denmark’s candidacy to serve as an elected member on the Security Council for the 2025- 2026 term. Its campaign message — equality, security, action — is a message from all the Nordic countries.
People working for peace, security, development and human rights should feel safe in their jobs. There have been 176 attacks on humanitarian workers so far this year, and 47 of those workers were killed. More than 50 peacekeepers have lost their lives while serving in United Nations missions. A few months ago, the Secretary-General and I inaugurated a work of art in this very building in memory of Zaida Catalan and Michael Sharp, who were murdered while working for the United Nations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In too many countries, civil-society representatives, human rights defenders and journalists are threatened, subjected to violence or even killed for expressing their opinions or reporting on current events. The global trend of democratic backsliding must be reversed, and we must break the vicious circle of a lack of democracy, disrespect for human rights and disregard of the rule of law. Investing in democracy means investing in peace and sustainable development. Efforts must continue to bring clarity to the circumstances of the death of former Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold and his crew. We fully support the work of the United Nations- appointed independent investigator.
To echo the topic of today’s debate, we are at a watershed moment. We are witnessing a full-scale war in Europe. Across the globe, armed conflict and repression cause suffering and halt development. We are not doing enough to tackle the climate crisis. Too many people are facing hunger, being forced to flee their homes, dying from curable diseases or living in fear or under oppression. We, the United Nations, must make sure there is a different story to tell next year. It will not be easy, but it is possible if we heed the call to meet our interlocking challenges with transformative change — and act when warnings sound."
Switzerland,CHE,Europe,"  8,526,000 ",61844,4.800000191,7.5,83.63,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,1249,14.65,"  8,526,000 ",100.00,10.93,"Twenty years ago, Switzerland spoke for the first time from this rostrum as a full Member of the United Nations (see A/57/PV.1). Switzerland’s joining the United Nations in 2002 was a special event. It was not solely a question of timing. Indeed, at the time Switzerland had already long been the host State of the European headquarters of the United Nations in Geneva. Switzerland was also active in various specialized agencies of the United Nations. No, the specificity of this event was quite different. Switzerland is the only country to have joined the Organization following a popular vote by its
people. That decision reflected the alignment between the values and goals of the United Nations and those anchored in the Swiss Constitution. That is why we feel so closely bound to the Charter of the United Nations. The principles enshrined in the Charter are more important than ever. Our world has rarely faced so many challenges as it does today. We are living in a pivotal moment, for ourselves, for the United Nations Charter and for the entire planet.
I was shocked by the military aggression launched by Russia, a great Power, against its neighbour Ukraine. Allow me to clarify that this military aggression violates the most basic principles of the Charter, which was adopted in the aftermath of the Second World War precisely with the aim of preventing wars. Switzerland reiterates its call on Russia to put an end to the war in Ukraine without further delay and to respect the latter’s territorial integrity. The consequences of this war affect the entire world, adding to the many other global crises that we must, of course, not forget.
Almost no continent today is spared by armed conflict. Tensions are growing among great Powers, among neighbouring States and even within certain countries. Every day, international humanitarian law and human rights are violated. That is intolerable and should alarm us. Serious human rights violations are indeed harbingers of possible escalations of violence and instability. If we examine a map of ongoing conflicts today, it becomes clear that a direct link almost always exists with other issues that destabilize our world, including: growing food insecurity; high energy prices and the issue of energy security; climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental pollution; even global health challenges, such as the coronavirus pandemic, which we have just experienced and not yet overcome, and whose heavy economic and social consequences we continue to feel.
Strengthened by its qualities and the experiences accumulated over the course of its history, Switzerland is determined to contribute its stone to the building in order to collectively find “transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, to quote the theme of this seventy-seventh session. My country, Switzerland, is distinguished not only by its system of direct democracy, its federalism, the stability that characterizes its politics and its economy, but also by its diversity and ability to derive innovative solutions therefrom. Those characteristics shape the way we manage conflicts and solve complex problems in our country. The Swiss culture of compromise and consensus is an appropriate one. Problems are tackled and resolved through dialogue that is sometimes difficult and slow, but that is peaceful. That certainly takes time, but it allows a broad consensus to be reached, leading to a final result more slowly than elsewhere. We have been a Member of the United Nations since 2002. We were not among the first. It was not a speedy process; however, it provides stability and durability to our situation.
That is precisely what happened when Switzerland joined the United Nations. I believe that our experience is also relevant to a world that, undoubtedly, is facing a new era due to the upheaval in Europe. Allow me therefore, in all modesty, to outline four elements that are of great value to Switzerland and that also seem to me to be decisive in meeting the many global challenges. The first is the importance of fundamental norms and values. The second is the inseparability of independence and cooperation. The third is the commitment to peace and security. The fourth is the courage to stay the course.
Let us take things in order. Starting with the importance of fundamental norms and values, public international law is essential. It is all the more essential the smaller a country is. We cannot allow the power of the strong to prevail over the rights of the weak. That is why Switzerland is committed to respecting public international law, which includes international humanitarian law and human rights. That is also why Switzerland is committed to the fight against impunity. We must all ensure that serious breaches of international law are punished. Those responsible must be held accountable for their actions, as for example in the case of the mass grave in the city of Izyum. In that context, values provide direction for our action.
We consider solidarity with the international community and sustainable development to be vital. In that regard, our common road map is the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which must enable our societies to be more resilient, more sustainable and more inclusive in the future. Some global circumstances have significantly slowed the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. Switzerland is proud, however, to have presented its second national report on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda this year. That report reveals the progress made, even if additional efforts must be made to achieve all the Goals. I therefore invite Member States to return to the fundamental values of the 2030 Agenda and to redouble their collective efforts towards its implementation.
The second point concerns the inseparable nature of independence and cooperation, which are not mutually contradictory. Under the Charter of the United Nations, each country is sovereign and thus independent. Like any country, Switzerland values its independence. That allows us to give the diversity of our culture and our population the attention it deserves. Switzerland has four national languages and great cultural diversity. It is made up of 26 distinct cantons, all of which were politically active long before the federal State. Given those characteristics, we have learned that cooperation, mutual respect and continuous dialogue are the only way to deal with difficulties. Independence and cooperation are actually two closely related concepts. Without cooperation, independence would mean isolation, and without independence, cooperation would be a constraint. An open dialogue between equals, a climate of trust and collaboration are also of paramount importance for international cooperation. Thanks to the international character of Geneva, Switzerland contributes to that dialogue. Geneva is the centre of multilateral diplomacy for matters relating to global governance, peace, human rights, disarmament, the environment and health. More recently, Geneva has become significant in terms of anticipating technological challenges. For all of us, the United Nations is a unique and universal platform for dialogue and cooperation. We must take full advantage of it.
My third point concerns the commitment to peace and security. Switzerland is a neutral country. That means that we strictly respect the right of neutrality anchored in public international law. We do not involve ourselves in conflicts or provide military support to either side of a conflict. Nothing can call that into question. However, neutrality does not mean indifference or the absence of solidarity. We are committed to safeguarding the principles of freedom, democracy and the rule of law — all values also anchored in the Swiss Constitution.
Switzerland was elected to the Security Council in this Hall on 9 June with 187 votes (see A/76/PV.79). We thank Member States for the strong mandate they have entrusted to us and for the trust they have shown in us. In submitting its application, Switzerland demonstrated that it, too, is ready to assume its responsibilities for safeguarding peace and security in the world. We will work tirelessly to live up to the trust Member States have placed in us and to embody our slogan, “A Plus for Peace”.
With that in mind, we have four priorities.
The first is to promote lasting peace. We want to make available our long-standing experience in the field of peace promotion and conflict prevention. In that context, we place special emphasis on the participation of women in peace processes.
Our second priority is to protect the civilian population. It is they who pay the heaviest price in conflicts. We will commit to the protection of civilians and to respect for international humanitarian law and human rights.
Our third priority is to strengthen the effectiveness of the Security Council. We have long been committed to the improved effectiveness of that fundamental organ of the United Nations, greater transparency in its work and the involvement of all actors concerned. We will pursue that path within the framework of our mandate.
Our fourth priority is to act for climate security. Climate change, one of the greatest challenges we face, also threatens peace and security. Therefore, we will mobilize to ensure that this issue is also dealt with within the Security Council.
Of course, our commitment to a more peaceful world is not limited to the Security Council. Switzerland hosted, alongside its Ukrainian partners, the conference on the reconstruction of Ukraine in the canton of Ticino, my birthplace. The resulting Lugano principles set widely accepted criteria for reconstruction and reform in Ukraine. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the involvement of our partners, the United Kingdom and Germany, in pursuing this process in 2023 and 2024, respectively. If the parties concerned so wish, Switzerland is always ready to provide its long and extensive experience of good offices.
The fourth element of great value to Switzerland is the courage to stay the course. We face complex challenges, yet we have limited resources. It is therefore essential to prioritize our action. What does that mean for multilateralism? It means that we must focus on the essential question of the peaceful and lasting coexistence of peoples and States. It means that we need a strong and effective United Nations, and it can be effective only if it is concentrated and focused. It means that a clear division of labour and better connectedness
of United Nations agencies is needed. It will then be possible to harness all the existing synergies.
It also means we need to further leverage science. I greatly appreciated the fact that the President of Assembly mentioned that collaboration with science in his statement this morning. We call it science diplomacy. The momentum offered by this new branch of diplomacy paves the way for new approaches and advances that can lead to concrete solutions.
The Swiss Government, with the canton of Geneva, is proud to have created in that spirit the Geneva Science and Diplomacy Anticipator (GESDA) Foundation. GESDA aims to anticipate the challenges posed by new technologies so as to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks for human beings, and to guarantee a sustainable future on our planet. Or, if I may put it another way, the targeted strengthening of multilateralism and the refocusing on core tasks are precisely the instrument that will allow us to jointly find a way out of these troubled times in which we live and to move towards a better future.
The United Nations offers a unique framework—the only current framework at the global level — to give concrete expression to the resolution enshrined in the preamble of its Charter, namely, to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security. That is our focus — we are partners, not adversaries."
Tanzania,TZA,Africa,"  56,313,000 ",2518,2.214999914,3.4,65.015,Cardiovascular Disease,Neonatal Disorder,Lower Respiratory Infection,2474,4.39,"  22,468,888 ",39.90,4.48,"I wish to begin by conveying to this august body fraternal greetings from Her Excellency Ms. Sarnia Suluhu Hassan, President of the United Republic of Tanzania, who could not attend this year’s session owing to pressing national commitments. It is therefore my distinct honour and privilege to address the United Nations General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session on behalf of the Government and the people of the United Republic of Tanzania.
Let me join those who have spoken before me in congratulating the President of the Assembly on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session. I assure him of Tanzania’s support and cooperation as he discharges his responsibilities.
Let me also extend our appreciation to the Secretary- General, His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres and the entire United Nations Secretariat for their dedicated service as guardians of the common interest of all peoples and all States, particularly during this time of unprecedented global challenges.
This Assembly is convening at a critical point, when the world is engulfed in dangerous flames ranging from conflicts and mounting geopolitical tensions, devastating effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, food and energy insecurity, environmental carnage and extreme climate-change-related events, to barriers to education, technology and opportunity for shared prosperity. These challenges are in turn inextricably linked with and propelling stubborn global poverty. Furthermore, with only eight years remaining before 2030, the world is still way off the mark in meeting many of the targets that we set in 2015.
The root cause of all these challenges is human greed, selfish desire and unilateralism. Yet we know for sure that unilateralism, driven by greed, is leading us, rich and poor, strong and weak, to a catastrophe. For it is now evident that these challenges have inflicted and continue to inflict enormous disruptive impacts on economies, ecosystems and social lives worldwide, with sub-Saharan African countries and other developing countries being hit disproportionately.
We have a famous proverb in Kiswahili that says, “Where there are problems, ingenuity increases.” In the spirit of this, we in Tanzania are convinced that transformative solutions to the global challenges we face are already at our disposal but subject to two conditions being met: first, there must be a passionate belief in the need to bring a caring spirit to considering the needs and happiness of other peoples and nations; and, secondly, there must be solemn adherence to the credo of multilateralism and collaborative efforts. Fortunately, both conditions are a restatement of the ideals, values and principles of the United Nations Charter.
Specifically, on the COVID-19 pandemic, the pandemic had devastating effects on Tanzania’s socioeconomic systems and performance. As it did for most other developing countries, the pandemic robbed us of precious lives, over-stretched health infrastructure and health-care workers to the limit and led to severe budget constraints and economic deceleration. Real gross domestic product growth declined from 6.7 per cent decadal growth attained in the pre-pandemic period to 4.8 per cent in 2020.
The key lesson we have learned from the COVID-19 pandemic is that the world needs to be better prepared in terms of national and global health systems in order to be able to handle future pandemics. This entails investing more in building health infrastructure and beefing up the health workforce, as well as enhancing national and regional capacity to manufacture drugs, supplies, vaccines and medical equipment.
In addition, Africa’s marginalization in the provision of vaccines underscored the need for African countries to work together in the development and nurturing of indigenous solutions through joint medical and scientific research. The pandemic also brought to the fore the need to invest more in public health education, especially preventive medicine to build individual resilience, including body fitness and healthy diet and habits.
However, I wish to acknowledge that although international support in taming the spread of the global pandemic, through provision of diagnostic equipment, medicines, vaccine support programmes and financing came late to Africa, it was critical in winning the war against the pandemic. Tanzania would therefore like to thank all our development partners that have been working with us to deal with the pandemic and put the country on a bright post- COVID-19 recovery path. Currently, the Government continues with its vaccination campaign whereby, as of 11 September, we already vaccinated 60.56 per cent of the targeted population.
With respect to climate change, we are indeed at a tipping point. The United Republic of Tanzania appreciates all individual efforts and other collective measures taken thus far to implement interventions geared at upscaling mitigation and adaptation as stipulated in the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 and the Paris Agreement of 2015. However, despite the efforts, we are observing unprecedented changes across the whole climate system in every region.
The fact remains that the most vulnerable countries, including Tanzania, have been disproportionately affected and that we do not possess the capacity to effectively respond. Tanzania has put forward ambitious targets on both adaptation and mitigation through nationally determined contributions (NDCs). The Government spends an average of $500 million per annum on adaptation measures and up to 3 per cent of its gross domestic product on mitigation and building community resilience. With the help of the international community, we are committed to continually updating our NDCs and making important progress to tackle climate change.
Yet, unless there are immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions,
limiting warming to at least 2°C will be elusive. As much as we remain committed, most developing countries have insufficient fiscal space and weak debt- sustainability status to address increasing demand for climate-resilience interventions. Addressing the climate crisis therefore requires reliable access to climate finance. It is on this note, that Tanzania calls on the international community to live up to its commitments made under the Paris Agreement. Enhanced capacity building, technology transfer and support for adaptation and mitigation measures, as well as the creation of an independent loss-and-damage financial facility must be implemented in order to scale up the fight against climate change. We need, as a matter of urgency, to take action and walk the talk.
At this point, I must emphasize that Tanzania and the rest of Africa need a just transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Africa must be given time to adjust since the majority of Africans have no access to energy. The well-established principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities must be observed. In this regard, we call upon the lifting of opposition to global financing and implementation of the transformative projects in our countries that aim to harness our hydrocarbon deposits for energy and other equally important uses to address our critical developmental needs. As long as robust environmental and social impact assessments have been done and concrete measures taken to effectively address the environmental and democratic governance concerns of our citizens, our sovereign rights to pursue transformative projects should be respected.
We also call upon transparency in the conduct of carbon-credit markets so that Africa benefits fairly from our earnest effort to take care of the carbon sinks that we are holding for the world. For example, Tanzania has preserved over 30 per cent of our total land area — a land mass almost equivalent to the size of Germany — which includes forests and wildlife parks.
In the maintenance of peace and security, Tanzania has always believed that diplomacy is the best instrument for resolving conflicts. Experience has taught us that, in war, everyone loses, including the non-warring parties. It is therefore our plea that, in the wake of global conflicts, our focus should remain to be on safeguarding human lives, especially children and women, and the well-being of people. Moreover, just recently, we have witnessed disruptive effects on global supply chains, dramatic increases in food and fuel prices as well as food shortages and declines in agricultural and industrial production around the world — all the more reasons to state that we all have a stake in pursuing the peaceful resolution of conflicts. As we do so, we must also leverage our abundant resources and human capabilities to address some of the impacts.
In the same spirit, peacekeeping operations remain one of the most dependable instruments for promoting world peace and security. Tanzania is proud to have contributed men and women in 5 of the existing 16 peacekeeping missions across the world. Despite this state of affairs, Tanzania stands ready to contribute more, if requested to do so. We also continue to actively participate in regional peace initiatives — and more so now in our capacity as a member of the African Union Peace and Security Council as well as the East African Community and Southern African Development Community. We therefore call upon the United Nations to enhance its support to regional efforts in peacebuilding and peacekeeping.
The credibility of the United Nations rests on a well-represented and responsive Security Council. We therefore wish to reiterate the common African position, as elaborated in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, with respect to the long-awaited reforms of the Security Council. It is well past time the Security Council reflected the present-day realities of the United Nations membership and not that of the 1940s.
I would be remiss if I did not end my statement without acknowledging that, the world celebrated the Kiswahili Language for the first time this year on 7 July, following the historic UNESCO declaration designating that date as World Kiswahili Language Day. As the birthplace of the Kiswahili language, Tanzania commends the efforts of the United Nations in promoting multilingualism as a core value, which is essential to achieving both the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union Agenda 2063.
To conclude, let me once again reaffirm the resolve of the United Republic of Tanzania to uphold the three pillars of the United Nations, namely, peace and security, development and human rights. I also call upon all of us to renew our commitment and prioritization of actions especially on those Sustainable Development Goals where we lag behind. We remain committed to working closely with the United Nations and its Member States in the spirit of multilateralism and global solidarity towards a sustainable future."
Thailand,THA,Asia,"  69,428,000 ",14341,1.082999945,6.0,76.931,Neoplasm,Cardiovascular Disease,Lower Respiratory Infection,6147,8.85,"  69,428,000 ",100.00,8.68,"At the outset, I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to the President of the General Assembly at its
seventy-seventh session and his entire team. I pledge Thailand’s full support as he undertakes to fulfil his important mission.
We are at a watershed moment as an international community and as the United Nations. We stand at a point where the decisions we make and the actions we pursue can shape the world and the course of humankind for years to come. But we can only do it together, guided by our shared interests and on the basis of mutual respect.
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has only exacerbated inequality gaps and has reversed at least four years of development gains, according to the United Nations Development Programme. At a time when the world is trying to recover from the two years of the pandemic, our problems are compounded by multiple challenges.
We are seeing new conflicts, on top of global geopolitical tensions. We are experiencing a food crisis, an energy crisis and a financing crisis. These have had the most detrimental impact on those who are most vulnerable — least developed countries, small island developing States and vulnerable groups, such as women, girls, the elderly and people with disabilities. Collective action is certainly needed now.
The food crisis has affected us all. This global food insecurity is due to conflicts, climate change, disruptions to supply chains and uneven recovery from COVID-19.
As such, there is an urgent need to strengthen multilateral action among like-minded partners, United Nations agencies, the World Trade Organization and international institutions in order to facilitate a constructive dialogue and improve policy coordination to address this crisis. It is now especially vital to keep our global supply chains open for seamless cross-border flows of food, fertilizers and essential goods, while also making our food systems more resilient so that equitable access to safe and healthy food for all can be guaranteed. Thailand is prepared to work in partnership with countries and international organizations in order to realize that vision.
In that context, Thailand welcomes the Black Sea Grain Initiative, established by the United Nations, to open a safe corridor for grain transportation that would help ease a global food crisis. The Initiative further stresses the importance of international cooperation under the Organization’s framework in order to respond to new global challenges.
In addition to overcoming food insecurity, we also need to overcome health insecurity. As we learned from the pandemic, good health for all is critical. And that is why universal health coverage should be a high priority for us all. We need to ensure access to high-quality essential health-care services and to safe, effective, high-quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for everyone. We must continue to promote and protect the right to receive the highest attainable standard of health as part of our commitment to human rights. We must continue to invest in promoting a more inclusive social protection system for all, as called for by the Secretary-General in Our Common Agenda (A/75/982).
To reinforce that, the global health architecture needs to be reformed, both structurally and functionally, in order to address the current shortcomings and systemic failures of health systems. And that is why Thailand fully supports the development of a legally binding international instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response under the World Health Organization (WHO). The new instrument must place equity at the centre in order to ensure the self-reliance of developing countries when faced with pandemics, especially through enhancing their capacity to manufacture certain medical countermeasures.
With better food and health security, we will be better positioned to putting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) back on track. In doing so, a human-rights-based approach is needed in order to ensure that the rights and basic needs of all persons are guaranteed, especially those of the most vulnerable and furthest behind. That will help enhance our resilience and capacity to cope with future crises. SDGs serve as both the pathway and the end goal in ensuring the survival of our present and future generations.
As we have only eight years left to attain the SDGs, we need to employ every tool at our disposal — from science, technology and innovation to working in partnership at every level in order to drive this agenda forward — because without sustainable development, there is no future. We need to promote North-South and South-South cooperation and the integration of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable peace with other cooperation frameworks, both at the global and regional levels. That is why the Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are working to enhance the complementarity between the 2030 Agenda for sustainable peace and the ASEAN Vision 2025. Thailand’s hosting of the Global South- South Development Expo with ESCAP and the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation in Bangkok last week also demonstrates the importance we place on development cooperation, especially among developing countries.
Furthermore, financing for development and finding innovative sources of finance are key to transforming SDGs from mere aspirations to a reality for all. Thailand agrees with the Secretary-General’s proposal to promote cooperation with leading global financial institutions in order to mobilize financing so as to drive forward the SDGs while improving financial liquidity for the least developed countries.
To promote sustainable development, Thailand has adopted the Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) Economy Model as a means to achieve a more balanced development in this recovery phase. The BCG Economy Model utilizes science, technology and innovation to encourage the optimization of resources for environmentally friendly economic growth.
In pursuing sustainable development, we need to ensure balance between our people-centred approaches and protecting our planet. To that end, Thailand is ready to work with the international community in order to contain the triple planetary crises of climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss. Thailand is committed to promoting international cooperation for the protection of the environment, including on the negotiations on the post-2020 global biodiversity framework and the international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution.
In tackling climate change, Thailand stands firm in our pledge at last year’s twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2065. And with adequate support, Thailand will be able to increase its nationally determined contributions or targets to 40 per cent while achieving net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050. That is not an empty promise. Thailand will submit our nationally determined contributions and long-term low greenhouse-gas emission development strategies that reflect those goals ahead of the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27), to be held in Sharm El-Sheikh.
Meanwhile, the pledges of developed countries must also be fulfilled. I urge developed countries to keep their promise of providing financial, technological and capacity-building support to developing countries and to deliver on the climate-financing goal of $100 billion annually as soon as possible. Equal attention should be paid to mitigation and adaptation. Thailand stands ready to work with Egypt and all partners at COP27 in that regard.
We need to restore faith and confidence in the multilateral system and our United Nations. An important step to achieving that is to reverse the polarization in this organ by working more closely on issues that bring us together. Addressing humanitarian concerns is one such issue.
Thailand will continue to work closely with the international community, taking into account the needs of the affected country, in order to address urgent humanitarian challenges through bilateral, regional and multilateral efforts, in accordance with the key humanitarian principles and without politicization. We have supported humanitarian work in Afghanistan through the World Food Programme (WFP) and have contributed to Ukraine through the Ukrainian Red Cross Society and UNICEF.
As for Myanmar, Thailand has worked with partners to provide humanitarian assistance to the people in need through various programmes at the bilateral level, including the donation of 1 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines and through ASEAN. Financial contributions were also made to support the work of international organizations, such as UNICEF, WHO, WFP and the International Committee of the Red Cross.
As an immediate neighbour, with the longest land border, of 2,470 kilometres, it is in Thailand’s vital interests to see a quick return to peace and stability in Myanmar. We call on all parties in Myanmar to urgently take steps to de-escalate, end the violence and engage in meaningful talks to resolve differences peacefully. Thailand fully supports the constructive role of ASEAN and believes that ASEAN is best placed to help Myanmar through the time-tested ASEAN practice of consultation, cooperation and consensus. Thailand will continue to play an active and constructive role to
support that ASEAN process, as well as the role of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General on Myanmar.
As a strong believer in multilateralism, Thailand stands ready to continue to do its part to promote multilateral and international cooperation at all levels. Sustainable development and human rights are intertwined and mutually reinforcing. They are vital in ensuring an environment of peace and prosperity. Thailand hereby presents its candidacy for membership of the Human Rights Council for the term from 2025 to 2027. If elected, we can help to strengthen the Human Rights Council and its mechanisms so as to reach out to the vulnerable and those furthest behind and bring about meaningful and real positive changes on the ground.
Thailand also firmly believes that close regional cooperation can complement the multilateral system and reinforce the global agenda. This year, Thailand plays host to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, which is meeting under the theme “Open. Connect. Balance”. Such a theme signifies the willingness to embrace every opportunity, connect in all dimensions and balance in all aspects. That highlights Thailand’s commitment to promoting multilateral cooperation, which will hopefully lead to more balanced and sustainable development after the COVID-19 pandemic. We look forward to welcoming world leaders to Bangkok in November, as Thailand is fully open and ready to welcome visitors once again.
Despite the challenges and difficulties at this critical juncture in the history of humankind, Thailand continues to have faith in the multilateral system, with the United Nations at its core. We remain confident that the goodwill and shared common interests of humankind will help us to make the right decisions at this watershed moment so that we can move together towards a more stable, sustainable and safer future, with no person or country left behind.
Let me now add this very brief account to end my statement. A few days ago, a sentiment was expressed by the European Union foreign policy chief when he said that we should not rule out the possibility of the use of nuclear weapons in the Ukraine crisis. An oriental saying that could be related to that context pertains to the enjoyment of riding a beast, whether it be a tiger or a dragon. Let us say a tiger in that context. Riding on the tiger’s back could be fun and challenging, but no one could enjoy riding on its back with no end in sight.
The question is how to safely dismount without killing the tiger.
Suddenly, the question of “how to” is daunting. We have a suggestion that takes all elements into account and is definitely not free of realpolitik. A possible breakthrough could be apparent during the month of November, with the third week of the penultimate month of the year as our first and golden opportunity for all super-stakeholders in the Ukraine crisis to assemble at three venues in South-East Asia as legitimate participants.
The three venues are one in Phnom Penh for the ASEAN Summit, another in Bali for the Group of 20 and the third in Bangkok for the APEC Economic Leaders Meeting. Separately or in a series, they could serve as a most appropriate platform for talks to provide a possible off-ramp or exit to the high-tension global crisis in Ukraine.
The world body, the United Nations, with all its relevant roles and mechanisms to help safeguard peace and stability, could certainly join in at any juncture to add value to that endeavour. Let us therefore hope that that golden opportunity is not passed up by all the super-Powers and super-stakeholders with regard to the high-tension Ukraine crisis."
Togo,TGO,Africa,"  7,889,000 ",1515,1.843999982,4.0,60.76,Cardiovascular Disease,Malaria,Neonatal Disorder,711,9.01,"  4,259,857 ",54.00,5.97,"After unprecedented formats of our General Assembly, following the constraints related to the coronavirus disease pandemic, we are again gathered here under the same roof to calmly debate the problems that disrupt the life of our world. The objective is to restore our common Organization to its fundamental values and principles, which have been severely tested by geopolitical rivalries, the temptation to dominate, national withdrawal and conflicts.
I would therefore like to welcome the theme chosen to guide the general debate of this session: “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”. But before I continue, allow me to extend to the President of the General Assembly at its seventy- seventh session my warmest congratulations on his election and our best wishes for success. I can assure him of my delegation’s support. I would also like to pay tribute to his predecessor for the work he accomplished in a rather difficult context.
On behalf of the President of the Togolese Republic, His Excellency Mr. Faure Essozimna Gnassingbe, I would like to pay a warm tribute to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his various initiatives to make our Organization more efficient.
During its 77 years of existence, the United Nations has worked tirelessly to prevent conflicts and maintain international peace and security. Today the threat to peace has changed. The inter-State conflicts of yesteryear have been replaced by new forms of violence involving actors who are difficult to capture.
Africa, spared for the time being, has become a sanctuary for terrorist groups. The terrorist threat, long confined to the countries of the Sahel, is spreading to the coastal countries on the Atlantic Ocean in West Africa. That is why the President of the Togolese Republic, His Excellency President Faure Essozimna Gnassingbe, has never ceased to invest personally in peace and stability in West Africa, and particularly in the Sahel. That determination has enabled the President of the Republic, as mediator in the crisis between the brotherly countries of Cote d’Ivoire and Mali, to obtain the release of three of the 46 remaining Ivorian soldiers. I would like to encourage all parties to show restraint and patience so that mediation can succeed.
The recent terrorist attacks in northern Togo, which left casualties and significant material damage in their wake, demonstrate the increasingly sophisticated means used by the jihadists. That situation is of the utmost concern to my delegation. That is why we welcome the adoption by consensus of the annual progress report of the Open-ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International and National Security on 29 July. Togo remains firmly committed to combating such criminals and driving them beyond its borders. In that regard, we will never waver.
In order to contribute to that pressing goal, Togo hosted the first Pan-African Cybersecurity Summit in Lome on 23 and 24 March. The Lome Declaration resulting from the Summit is a commitment to combating cyberthreats. In that context, my country welcomes the work under way in the Ad Hoc Committee to Elaborate a Comprehensive International Convention on Countering the Use of Information and Communications Technologies for Criminal Purposes and encourages all stakeholders to engage in developing such a legal instrument.
Beyond the military response, we are fully aware that the fight against terrorism also depends on the degree of trust between the army and the population and between the latter and the Government. We therefore work daily to combat the root causes of the spread of violent extremism, which fuels terrorism. Togo also took innovative and multisectoral measures, as set out in its strategy document to combat violent extremism, adopted on 1 July. To that end, an emergency programme for the Savannah region, with a budget of $9,104,704, was drawn up for the implementation of various projects up to 2025 in the water, energy, health, infrastructure, education and agriculture sectors.
We are in a new phase of the asymmetric war against that terrorist insurgency. The deterioration of the security situation must be of concern to us all, particularly the United Nations. To that end, it is important to successfully revitalize our Organization and do our utmost to reform the Security Council.
I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Global Programme on the Protection of Vulnerable Targets, from which my country, Togo, benefits as a pilot country. That United Nations Programme, aimed at strengthening the capacities of Member States and providing them with logistical support for the protection of vulnerable targets against terrorist attacks, has proved to be of great importance to our countries.
The other major challenge facing humankind is climate change. All the experts’ reports on that issue are worrisome. That phenomenon is all the more of concern because it affects all countries in the world, including, unfortunately, the least polluting countries, such as ours.
Togo adopted a robust policy for the restoration of vegetation cover, with an ambitious programme for a green transition. The Togolese Government is firmly committed to ensuring the sustainable management of natural resources and resilience to the impact of climate change. With a view to sustainable management and protection, the Togolese Government has therefore focused its priorities, among other things, on improving marine and coastal ecosystems, regulating fishing and promoting the blue economy. Lastly, as part of the preservation and restoration of ecosystems and combating desertification, Togo launched a major national reforestation programme of 1 billion trees by 2030, banned the import, marketing and use of glyphosate and all products containing it and promoted the use of biopesticides and biofertilizers in the country.
We very much hope that the upcoming twenty- seventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Egypt from 7 to 18 November, will help to bring environmental conservation back to the centre of the international agenda by urging stakeholders to honour the financing pledges needed to address global warming.
In the area of renewable energy, Togo established strategic partnerships for the provision of reliable, modern and low-cost services in rural areas. Consequently, the fund for access to electricity for all, called the Tinga fund, the Cizo, or Sun, project for the supply of solar-energy kits to rural and vulnerable populations, photovoltaic power plants, miniature solar power plants and solar street lamps were set up throughout the country, contributing to the widespread use of renewable energy in Togo.
On the economic and social front, Togo adopted a Government road map up to 2025, whose vision is to make Togo a modern nation with inclusive and sustainable growth. The road map has three main axes, namely, strengthening inclusion and social harmony and ensuring peace, boosting job creation by building on the economic potential and modernizing the country by strengthening its structures.
The reform of the business climate enabled Togo to significantly increase foreign direct investment in the country. Similarly, the strengthening of development cooperation has contributed to the increased mobility of foreign resources due to the new momentum created by the adoption of the Government’s road map and its endorsement by development stakeholders, the establishment of new partnerships and the revitalization of existing partnerships.
The major challenge for Togo is to implement and strengthen its national social protection system. Improving people’s access to basic social services and strengthening inclusion mechanisms also remain fundamental to poverty reduction. To achieve that, the Government has included the principle of leaving no one behind in public policies.
As a result, other innovative initiatives have made it possible to expedite the inclusion of all social groups. Those include the adoption of the law establishing universal health insurance and the WEZOU digital platform, set up in 2021, to take care of pregnant women and newborns in order to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality. Strengthening women’s protection against discrimination and gender-based violence and reducing sociocultural barriers have considerably improved the contribution of the female population to the country’s development.
Togo set up a mechanism for the financial inclusion of the most vulnerable sectors of the population through cash transfers. A project for the development of social-safety nets and basic services, as well as a programme to support vulnerable populations, was established. In addition, an incentive mechanism for agricultural financing based on risk-sharing and a plan
to structure and improve rural agricultural training and integration were launched.
To conclude my remarks, I would like to encourage everyone to consider the foundations of multilateralism and the aims of the founding fathers in devising that system of global governance. At the seventy-fifth session of the General Assembly, we had a wide-ranging debate on the United Nations we want and reaffirmed our commitment to multilateralism. The important declaration (resolution 75/1) adopted at the commemoration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations adequately reflects the new multilateral ambition to which we committed, and which, moreover, aims to be just and equitable. It also seeks to show us that we are the driver of development and sustained global growth.
Today we are called on to take concrete action to address the many challenges that plague our world, including terrorism and security challenges, as well the coronavirus disease. However, unfortunately, we see that all too often we flout our multilateral commitments. We have at times taken away their substance, their strength and their roots. How else can we understand why the Security Council remains so exclusive? Why not work in good faith to reform that important organ of the international security system by making it more representative of the current world realities?
Based on that analysis, we come to the following conclusion. Today we are convinced that African countries, and Africa in general, no longer want to align themselves with any of the major Powers due to the shortcomings of the concept of multilateralism. The role attributed to Africa in the twenty-first century reflects the image that certain Powers still have of our continent as solely their area of influence. Africa has virtually no impact on the current world order, while it is drastically affected by the consequences of the disruptions in international affairs. It is only of interest to certain Powers when they find themselves in trouble. We must be concerned about Africa’s place on the world stage. In truth, today Africa does not occupy the place that it should in the international arena.
For many Powers, the African continent has no role to play as a major actor, in the Kantian sense of the word, in the international arena. They think that they live in the same world, whereas the world has profoundly changed. When the United Nations was established in 1945, apart from two African countries that we all know — Liberia and Ethiopia — African countries were not yet independent. After 77 years, unfortunately, it is the same international system that remains in place because of the will of the five permanent members of the Security Council, known to us all.
Although the African integration project is still in progress, a consensus has since emerged among African States at the level of the African Union, as recalled at this session by the President of Senegal, Chairperson of the African Union, with regard to the need for the continent to obtain two permanent representative seats on the Security Council, in addition to the two non-permanent member seats allocated to African States (see A/77/PV.4). Despite the general consensus of 54 Member States, the reluctance of some of the five permanent members to see Africa take up those seats is clear. Unfortunately, Africa’s voice does not seem to be heard, as some simply do not want Africa to be a strong continent.
The great Powers want to reduce Africa to a merely functional entity in the service of their causes and clearly do not want the continent to be able to play a significant, or even a leading, role in the world. They usually try to get Africans to subscribe to their narrative and, in the end, Africans are used to support one side against another. When it comes to voting on a draft resolution in the Security Council, we are actively lobbied by both sides. Africa is then greatly in demand, and even put under pressure by some of its partners.
Today we believe that such attitudes and actions, which belong to another era, take place in a historical context in which Africa has become aware of its own responsibility and is increasingly speaking with one and the same voice. The divides of the colonial era between a so-called, inter alia, French-, Portuguese-, English- or Arabic-speaking Africa have lessened, as have the post-Cold war ideologies that dominated the second half of the twentieth century. Today Africa wants to be itself. In truth, Africa is Africanophone, if you will allow that neologism. Africa today is no longer the Africa of the 1945s, let alone the 1960s. Today we have a host of new partners in Africa that are an integral part of the new international geopolitics, far removed from the two opposing blocs that shaped the post-war world of the twentieth century. The world has decentred to become multipolar. To paraphrase Blaise Pascal, the world is now a sphere whose centre is both everywhere and nowhere. Africa no longer can, or wants to, be the carriages of a single locomotive.
In reality, many African countries no longer feel too bound, in the sense of being tied, by colonial history and are eager to work with new partners. All those changes, linked to history itself, whose essence is perpetual evolution, as well as to the clear desire for a paradigm shift in the level of cooperation in Africa, should lead some Powers to change their approach if they want to continue to work with Africans. There is a need for a change of mentality and behaviour of our partners who come to Africa, each of whom without exception has an agenda dictated primarily by their own interests.
Africa expects more equality, respect, equity and justice in its relations and partnerships with the rest of the world and the major Powers, regardless of who they are. Today Africans want to be real partners with the rest of the world. The community of nations must listen to Africa in order to give purpose to our dialogue. Failure to listen distorts the purpose of dialogue, turning it into a juxtaposition of monologues and partial arguments, sometimes under the guise of pseudo-multilateralism, which runs the risk of distorting the relationship.
In this world of ours, it is only by collectively pooling our intelligence that we will be able to reach agreement on objectives to achieve collectively. Although the major problems we continue to face are the same, they are perceived in different ways by the North and the South. When it comes to major international issues, listening to African voices means more than just calibrating the discussion. Africa’s megaphone may not be as loud as those of the world’s major Powers, but Africa’s voice counts and must count for those who seek to partner with it on major international issues.
Africa is in fact waiting for a real partnership and our allies must make an effort to take on the spirit of such a partnership. Our allies cannot always expect unconditional support from our continent. Africa wants to cooperate with its allies on the basis of its own best interests. To that end, our partners need to abandon fantasies that were largely forged in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and are clearly out of step with the twenty-first century, in which national and regional challenges have global implications and global challenges have regional, national and even local manifestations and ramifications. The current international economic repercussions and disruptions directly resulting from the return of war to Europe are a clear example of that.
In reality, we are all exposed to the same threats and challenges to our survival and even our existence. However, we deeply believe that we can build a prosperous, more stable and safer world for our peoples through an enhanced and effective multilateralism. Our only option for achieving that is restoring, under the aegis of the United Nations, the strength and determination in our collective capacity for dialogue, resilience and solidarity, which will enable us to make our planet habitable again for all and to sustainably build our shared world together.
We should — and I truly mean this — read our founding texts more often and learn to respect and consider the smallest, weakest and the most fragile among us. Yes, we believe that another world is possible. It is inevitable for all of us, because in truth — and here I paraphrase the famous scientist Albert Einstein on the subject of war — I do not know what the Third World War will be like, but I do know that there would not be many people left to see the fourth."
Tunisia,TUN,Africa,"  11,565,000 ",10621,15.38000011,4.7,76.505,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,383,3.31,"  11,565,000 ",100.00,6.49,"At the outset, I wish to congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi and his friendly country Hungary on presiding over the seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly, and offer him Tunisia’s support for the guidelines he has outlined. “Solidarity, sustainability and science” are indeed basic components of the solutions we are looking for.
I also extend deep appreciation to Mr. Abdulla Shahid for his capable management of the work of the previous session of the General Assembly, against the backdrop of grave challenges whose repercussions are still being felt and unfortunately foretell further difficulties.
Thanks are due to Mr. Antonio Guterres for his ongoing efforts to strengthen the role of our Organization and to ensure an effective response to our challenges and to contain their impacts, especially through the implementation of Our Common Agenda (A/75/982). That Agenda, with all its contents, provides a ray of hope for the international community at a time of concerns about our capacity to overcome the consequences of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic at the health, economic and humanitarian levels. We have found in the Agenda and in other United Nations references that we have supported and engaged in — such as the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development — a path towards common solutions within a framework of solidarity and parity so that no one is left behind.
Unfortunately, however, many peoples today are threatened to be left behind as a result of international financial structural imbalances and limited international solidarity amid exacerbated risks and threats of disputes, conflicts, political crises and unprecedented natural disasters due to climate change, in addition to the terrible flows of irregular migration and the increase in the number of refugees, not to mention the millions of people threatened by famine, malnutrition and extreme poverty.
At a time when we were trying to overcome the repercussions of COVID-19 and its devastating effects, which will be felt for many years to come, the Russian- Ukrainian crisis has returned us to a state of uncertainty. Indeed, the world today is facing a severe food and energy crisis as a result of the disruption of production and supply chains, shortages of basic materials, unprecedented high food prices, the deterioration of purchasing power, and high rates of inflation, debt and debt servicing.
Today we are indeed facing a defining moment in our history and common destiny that calls on all of us to find radical and transformative solutions that will allow our peoples to overcome the current circumstances, enhance our resilience and build the sustainability we hope for.
Our peoples are watching us at this session and wondering whether the international community is truly capable of implementing transformative solutions and whether we have the political will to address the global crises that are escalating and accumulating.
At each session, new issues are added to the old ones, so are we simply postponing today’s solutions until they become tomorrow’s problems? Are we assuming our responsibility for the future of coming generations? Today’s solutions must protect us from tomorrow’s crises, and those solutions cannot be formulated within traditional policies and approaches.
In this context, Tunisia stresses once again that circumstantial solutions to certain issues do not fundamentally resolve them, but are merely palliatives. Over the decades, such remedies have proven unable to provide radical and effective solutions to various crises. We need new policies based on solidarity and justice, such as those contained in the Secretary-General’s report Our Common Agenda. The repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequences of the situation in Ukraine have revealed the need to review those approaches so that we can save the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals before it is too late, as indicated by the Secretary-General. In that context, I would like to emphasize the following.
First, solutions cannot be formulated outside the framework of multilateral action and human solidarity, and in cooperation and coordination with the United Nations, while preserving the other frameworks and mechanisms as tributaries for that cooperation. They complement and complete such coordination, without competing with it or weakening its ability to provide solutions. That is what Tunisia emphasized recently on the occasion of our country’s hosting, on 27 and 28 August, the eighth Tokyo International Symposium on Development in Africa, where we discussed many items on our agenda, including how to achieve sustainable development through approaches in which economic, security and humanitarian dimensions are integrated.
Secondly, we need to adopt an economic approach that focuses on the quality of economic growth and not its speed, especially by investing more in knowledge, science, innovation and modern technologies. In Tunisia, we look forward to the Francophonie Summit, which will be hosted on the island of Djerba on 19 and 20 November, under the theme “Connectivity in diversity: Digital as a vector of development and solidarity in the Francophonie space”. The recommendations of the Summit should promote ways to achieve our common goals in the digital, technological and development fields.
Thirdly, we must take a qualitative leap in debt management through new development approaches and in how the global financial system can provide financial support without unfair conditions or dicta that do not take into account the specificities and circumstances of developing and least developed countries, especially in the African region, where the global financial system has not offered the support they expected in their efforts to overcome the existing challenges and in their quest for recovery and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. That was confirmed by the Secretary-General recently when he spoke of a disruptive global financial system that disappoints developing countries. In that context, Tunisia calls for a restructuring of debt into investment projects to generate wealth. It also stresses the importance of enabling peoples to recover their looted funds that were smuggled abroad.
Fourthly, the international community must today renew its commitment to the African continent on the basis of solidarity, equality and equal partnership, while listening to its development and security concerns.
Fifthly, the challenges facing the world today cannot be addressed without consolidating the elements of international peace and security, based on the rule of international law and international legitimacy. In that context, it is necessary to work on settling conflicts peacefully without selectivity, putting an end to absurd conflicts, refraining from fabricating crises and finding solutions to just causes, foremost of which is the Palestinian question, which requires an end of the occupation and the establishment of an independent Palestinian State, with Jerusalem as its capital.
Sixthly, we must realize that every country, without exception, has its own challenges, problems and peculiarities. There is no one-size-fits-all mode or model. Let us agree that there are principles, values and common denominators that unite us and that we are all obligated to respect, but the details of choices and directions remain within the sovereign purviews of States. There is no democracy, but there are democracies.
Democracy in Tunisia represents an unshakable national option, which we are working to strengthen and preserve through a corrective path whose phases will be completed by the legislative elections of 17 December.
Tunisia’s democratic choice arises from the will of the Tunisian people, who are determined to make their democratic experience a success and complete their political path under the auspices of a State that preserves their constitutional rights, freedoms, security and dignity, in which the law is supreme and the people are sovereign.
Tunisia has demonstrated in various regional and international forums its adherence to human rights and freedoms with further support and development. It has contributed to enriching the United Nations system in that regard with several initiatives and contributions that are recognized for their credibility and sustained, firm alignment with common universal principles.
The stakes before us today can be addressed only with a true common resolve to go beyond the diagnosis stage to the action and response stage through the optimal utilization of our capabilities and capabilities and by activating multilateral action. Our peoples are tired of unfulfilled promises, so let us all rise to that defining moment and rebuild trust in our national and international institutions so as to move towards achieving our common goals of building a better world for us and for future generations, a world that is worthy of human beings wherever they are, while preserving their security and dignity and realizing their well-being and sustainability."
Turkey,TUR,Asia,"  82,340,000 ",18784,11.26299953,5.2,77.437,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Chronic Respiratory Disease,2003,2.43,"  82,340,000 ",100.00,9.23,"I would like to wholeheartedly greet everyone on behalf of myself and my nation. I hope and pray that the seventy- seventh session of the General Assembly will yield the best possible results for us, our countries and the entire human race. I would also like to congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi for having assumed the presidency of the General Assembly and for his theme for this year’s session of the General Assembly, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, which appears to be very appropriate.
We meet at a time when we are trying to sort out many challenges on a global scale. One of the biggest lessons of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic was how to build international solidarity in resolving global threats. During the pandemic, Tiirkiye managed to provide humanitarian aid, without any discrimination, to more than 161 countries and 12 international organizations. We also contributed to the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility, as well as national and local vaccine efforts, in the service of the entire human race. Last year, we ratified the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in order to demonstrate the extent of our resolve in the fight against climate change and our aim of becoming a zero-emission country by 2053. We also convened the sixteenth Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in Istanbul, which showed our willingness to become pioneers in the fight against climate change.
The global economy was impacted heavily by the supply-chain problems caused by the pandemic, and with the addition of the Russia-Ukraine crisis we are experiencing a new wave of shock. Energy, food and raw materials prices are increasing, creating the enormous pressure of inflation, which has significant ramifications for the world’s economies and social welfare systems. Those developments have proved once again the high importance of energy supply security. Since the shock began, Tiirkiye has focused on energy not as an issue of competition but as an area for cooperation. Taking into account our own needs, we have revived many projects to support energy security, not only in our region but also on a global scale. In the light of recent developments, our approach has proved to be effective.
The situation we are facing has also jeopardized food supply security. This is the twenty-first century — we have never had as many financial and technological opportunities as we do now. Yet one fifth of the world’s population still currently faces crippling rates of poverty and hunger. The world was aiming to reach zero poverty and hunger by the year 2030 under the Sustainable Development Goals, but given recent developments it seems like we are moving away from our projected achievements. It is time for us to shed light on our path, and that can be done only through international cooperation and solidarity and by taking just and fair approaches to our dealings with one another. We need to take action together to combat the challenges of our common fate. Tiirkiye is willing to demonstrate its willingness to do that, as we have done with the pandemic and the climate change crisis.
We have also demonstrated our stance in combating the crisis caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The Ukrainian conflict has surpassed the seven-month threshold, and we believe that while there will never be a winner in this war, a fair peace process should not have any losers. That is important to us, as we have consistently underlined the importance of using diplomacy, through dialogue, in order to settle disputes once and for all. That is why we brought together the parties at the Antalya Diplomacy Forum, and then in Istanbul, in order to facilitate the reconciliation process.
As a result of our significant efforts together with the Secretary-General, we have managed to export Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, and it has found its way to other global markets. The agreement reached in Istanbul to enable those exports, the Black Sea Grain Initiative, is still critical, and those exports will increase over time. That agreement, undertaken jointly with the United Nations, is one of our Organization’s greatest accomplishments in recent decades. I think that the international community has revived its confidence in the United Nations as a result of the agreement in Istanbul, because it proved once again that negotiations can yield results, especially on issues that are vital to all the parties involved.
We have taken a similar approach to the issue of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, which is threatening the security of the entire globe. The conflict is escalating, and we are investing tremendous efforts in order to ensure an end to the war by definitively protecting Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. We urge all the international organizations and countries of the world to support Tiirkiye’s peaceful initiatives to settle the dispute once and for all. We need a dignified way
out of this crisis, which can be found only through a rational, fair and appropriate diplomatic solution.
On the other hand, all the disasters affecting millions of people have shown once again that the United Nations will have to be much more effective and influential and that it has a responsibility to invest further efforts in resolving problems on a global scale. The United Nations will have to be much more inclusive and be capable of creating effective solutions for a fairer world. The United Nations must become an international organization in which the common will of the entire human race can be advanced. The Security Council in particular must be more effective, democratic, transparent, accountable and functional in order to help the entire human race in its search for peace, justice and welfare. That is going to be a turning point for us all. In order to remember our collective responsibility, we have been reiterating that one world is better than five and that a fairer world is still possible. We have repeated those remarks on every platform at every opportunity. We are committed and determined in our fight, and we expect the entire world to support us. I therefore once again call on the Assembly for its support.
Our foreign policy vision has been always peace-oriented. We have worked tirelessly, beginning in our region, to ensure that peace prevails in the entire world. In our “Mediation for peace” initiative, which we conduct under the auspices of the United Nations, we have worked tirelessly to resolve conflicts in Europe, Latin America, Africa and other areas. We seek to act as a mediator or facilitator in order to settle disputes once and for all. Our country is located in the heart of a region surrounded by conflict, but we seek to be a part of the solution rather than a part of the problem, which is possible only through the initiatives that we choose to undertake.
In that regard, we have always stressed that a peaceful, permanent reliable settlement must be found for the Syrian conflict in the framework of Security Council resolution 2254 (2015). I believe that, if that conflict continues, it will threaten Syria’s territorial security and welfare and that of our region. Our country has hosted 4 million civilians of Syrian descent to date.
I think that the Security Council must shoulder its responsibility to extend resolution 2642 (2022), enabling the humanitarian aid mechanism that was established in Syria’s north-west. There, we are fighting terrorist organizations such as the Kurdistan Workers’ Party and its offshoots, which pose a significant and clear threat to Tiirkiye and its security forces. That terrorist organization changes its name on a continuous basis and tries to legitimize itself. We must urge global forces to stop weaponizing those terrorist organizations and stop making the same mistakes of the past.
We are powerful enough to take every necessary measure against terrorism, and I want to remind everyone of that again. We will never shy away from combating terrorism and will always be very resolved to take the necessary measures to combat it. We seek to do everything in our capacity and with the utmost sincerity to ensure that our Syrian brothers and sisters are able to return to their country in a dignified, safe and secure manner.
We seek to create conditions that are conducive to returning civilians who fled the war to their motherland and ensuring that they lead dignified lives. We are building 100,000 brick homes in several parts of Syria so that they can seek refuge there. The vast majority of those homes have already been completed and handed over to their owners. We have also started preparations to build an additional 200,000 housing units so that 1 million Syrians will be able to go back to their homeland. Those projects will be completed in safe zones in a total of 13 different centres and rural areas, and we need the support of the international community in order for that to be possible. We need all the stakeholders in that project to demonstrate serious solidarity and commitment.
Irregular migration — the refugee crisis — cannot be solved by leaving people to their demise, building border walls and placing them in refugee camps. We can solve that problem only through efforts focused on humankind and human life. That approach is being taken in Greece, and we can clearly see that the Greeks are becoming much more tolerant towards the refugees around the Aegean Sea and the eastern Mediterranean.
Tiirkiye does not want to see the bodies of babies such as Aylan being washed ashore. But at the same time, Greece is unfortunately pushing back those refugees in an illegal and deliberate manner, turning the Aegean into a graveyard for refugees. Last week, a 9-month-old baby named Assam and a 4-year-old, Abdul Wahab, died because the Hellenic Coast Guard forces sank their boats. I think that it is high time for Europe, as well as the United Nations and other international
organizations, to say “stop” and “that is enough” to such crimes, which are crimes against humanity.
In another of our neighbouring countries, Iraq, we seek to invest significant efforts in order to ensure that peace and prosperity can be established there as well. We want political reconciliation to be established and political unity to be formed within the framework of an Iraqi identity. We must work together in order to sustainably establish prosperity in Iraq and stop the abuses being committed by terrorist organizations there. Nevertheless, there are terrorist organizations that continue to abuse Iraq’s instability, and we will never stop fighting the Iraq-based terrorist organizations that have taken violent action against Tiirkiye.
As I have said in this Hall many times, we will fight terrorism without any discrimination, and our commitment to genuine solidarity will help us achieve our goals. We will fight back against terrorism in all its forms, regardless of the names of its groups, and we want our allies — our friends — to provide us with the solidarity and commitment we need. It is natural for us to expect others to cooperate with us rather than terrorist organizations and tyrant regimes. We want our neighbours to forge solidarity with us in order to contribute to the stability, peace and welfare of our entire region and the world, and we are ready to work with them.
From a global security perspective, we need to focus on North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean. In that framework, it is critical to establish stability and welfare in Libya, not only for the world but also for the entire region. Tiirkiye strongly supports the efforts of the United Nations in that regard. We want to protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of the Libyan people and ensure that they attain their much-desired level of prosperity. Fair and universal elections should be held in Libya, and a strong Government with the legitimacy of the will of the people must be established there, which is something that we all have to work towards.
In order to ensure peace and prosperity throughout the Middle East, we need to put an end to the Israeli- Palestinian conflict once and for all by establishing a two-State solution, which is something we strongly support. We must preserve the historical and cultural identity of Jerusalem and respect Haram Al-Sharif, and we must stop the illegal settlements in the occupied regions by establishing security guarantees for Palestinians and their property. We must establish a permanent and fair solution for the region, with East Jerusalem as the capital and through the establishment of a free and sovereign Palestinian State. That is the only solution. It is in the best interests of the Palestinian people, the Israeli people, the region and the entire world. We will contribute efforts to making that possible.
It is also the international community’s responsibility to increase the institutional and financial capacity of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.
We are also concerned about the problems in Iran. We have always supported the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. We need diplomacy and dialogue to settle the disputes regarding Iran’s nuclear programme once and for all.
With regard to Azerbaijan, the liberation of its occupied territories has offered a historic opportunity for a permanent peace and stability in the South Caucasus. Tiirkiye has been supportive of the process between Azerbaijan and Armenia. We have taken significant steps to make the best use of that opportunity. Recent clashes have cast a dark shadow on those positive developments, but we believe that it is still possible to achieve sustainable peace between those two countries. We will always stand by our Azerbaijani brothers in building their homes and their future in a legitimate and justified manner.
The opening, without delay, of the transportation routes in the region, which is an issue that also concerns our country closely, will contribute tremendously to the welfare the entire region.
At the same time, Afghanistan has struggled with conflicts, terrorism and poverty for almost half a century and is currently experiencing a challenging period. The interim Government must take the necessary steps to protect fundamental human rights, which could pave the way for some promising developments. Tiirkiye will continue supporting its Afghan brothers and sisters during that process.
India and Pakistan, following the establishment of their sovereignty and independence 75 years ago, still have not established peace and solidarity between one another, which is unfortunate. We hope and pray that fair and permanent peace and prosperity will be established in Kashmir.
We would like to extend our sincere condolences to the people of Pakistan with regard to the catastrophic
floods that they recently experienced. In response to the flood, we launched a humanitarian aid campaign, which is ongoing. We call on the international community to support the Pakistani people during this regrettable and painful period.
We support the safe, voluntary and dignified return of the Rohingya Muslims to their homeland.
We are very sensitive to the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the Muslim Uyghur Turks in such a way that it will not threaten the territorial integrity and sovereignty of China.
In the Balkans, we are investing tremendous efforts on multiple platforms to strengthen peace and stability and to settle disputes through dialogue. At the beginning of September, we conducted an official visit to the region, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Croatia. I think that the finalization of elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina will contribute tremendously to the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue process and the stability of the region.
As a country, Tiirkiye wants all the issues in the Aegean Sea and in the eastern Mediterranean to be resolved within the framework of good-neighbourly relations and in conformity with international law. Those countries that pursue a show of force in our region seem foolish and are no match for us. In the eastern Mediterranean, peace and stability depends on respect for the rights of all the parties. We expect Greece to set aside its provocative policies and to heed our calls for cooperation and solidarity.
We believe that the eastern Mediterranean conference, which we have recommended previously, will serve that purpose. The fact that our interlocutors have not made even the slightest effort to respond to that call shows who supports peace and dialogue and who supports conflict. Tiirkiye will always defend its rights in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean and will never yield to the escalation strategies led by other countries.
With regard to the Cyprus issued, we have always sought to reach a just, lasting and sustainable resolution, and we are working together with the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus to that end. There are two States and two different peoples on that island, and that should be universally accepted. The acceptance of the equal sovereignty and the international status of the Turkish Cypriots is key to a settlement on the island. We hereby call on the international community to put an end to the oppression of the Turkish Cypriots and to the sanctions imposed on them.
Greece, a member of the European Union, is inhumanely pushing back refugees in the Aegean Sea and is imposing policies against the Turkish Muslim minority in violation of its legal obligations. We hope that Greece will bring an end to all those wrongful practices and that the European Union will stop turning a blind eye to those inhumane and unlawful actions.
The value of Tiirkiye’s cooperation with the European Union is important in addressing regional and global challenges. As a strong ally of NATO, Tiirkiye is celebrating its seventieth anniversary as a member of the organization. We have diplomatic initiatives and military capabilities that are contributing to the security of the Euro-Atlantic region. We seek to contribute to the security, stability and prosperity of the European continent. And as a part of Asia on the Western coast of Europe, we are also leading initiatives on the Asian continent, such as the Asia Anew initiative, with a view to assuming a more proactive role.
We are trying to establish closer contacts and solidarity with African countries through the recent global initiatives that we have undertaken. In that context, in Istanbul from 16 to 18 December 2021, we held the third Tiirkiye-Africa Partnership Summit, which was widely attended by our African friends. Tiirkiye has always shown its commitment, as an equal partner, to Africa’s journey towards stability, development and prosperity.
Our cooperation with Latin America is also getting stronger, on the basis of mutual respect, and we are going to invest efforts institutionally to become more proactive in Latin America.
The international community is being shaken by several challenges. The biggest threat we are currently facing is the loss of the will to live together.
We are deeply concerned by the rise of racism, discrimination, xenophobia and Islamophobia in recent years. We have repeatedly called for 15 March, the date on which the terrorist attack against Muslims in New Zealand took place, to be declared the International Day to Combat Islamophobia, and we reiterate that appeal once again. We have taken action, first within the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and subsequently within the General Assembly, to ensure that that date is
declared the International Day to Combat Islamophobia, and hope that wish will be realized.
As I have emphasized many times before, we consider Islamophobia along the same lines as antisemitism. We also consider it a crime against humanity. With that in mind, I hope that the General Assembly, at its seventy- seventh session, will be able to accomplish the goals that will respond to the expectations and aspirations of the entire human race. I extend my wishes for health and peace to all States. Once again, I wish to express to all Member States, on my behalf and on behalf of my nation, my appreciation and respect."
Turkmenistan,TKM,Asia,"  5,851,000 ",22328,3.401000023,4.6,68.073,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Digestive Disease,337,5.76,"  5,851,000 ",100.00,Not Avalable,"At the outset, I have the honour to convey the greetings and wishes of peace and prosperity to the peoples of all countries from the President of Turkmenistan, His Excellency Mr. Serdar Berdimuhamedov.
I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session, and wish him success in that important and responsible post.
I express my gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid, President of the Assembly at its seventy-sixth session, for his effective work in this position.
Turkmenistan sees the current session of the General Assembly from the point of view of the need to urgently leverage the potential of the world community and the United Nations constructive influence on global processes, the search for channels of dialogue as the only acceptable way to resolve conflicts and contradictions, lay down the foundations for developing responsible joint approaches to the problems of postpandemic development, and restore economic and humanitarian ties.
For Turkmenistan, the new political year marks an important date — the thirtieth anniversary of its membership of the United Nations. Based on the solid foundation of engagement with this world Organization that we built over the years, and reaffirming our commitment to a strategic partnership with the United Nations and our conviction that there is no alternative to the only world structure with universal legitimacy, Turkmenistan will pursue its efforts to enhance and strengthen its role in the world and reaffirm internationally recognized legal norms and the Charter of the United Nations as the political and ideological bases of intergovernmental relations.
The global security architecture created within the framework of our Organization is now being seriously tested. We are witnessing complex processes that hinder multilateral cooperation, including in such important areas as security and stability. In order to overcome the current difficulties in international relations, Turkmenistan considers it necessary to strengthen existing platforms for dialogue and to consider establishing new ones for intergovernmental contact and negotiations on pressing issues on the global agenda.
Restoring trust and a culture of respectful dialogue is gaining universal significance as one of the key conditions for a responsible, non-confrontational approach, seeking opportunities for mutual understanding and maintaining a balance of interests when considering problematic issues. In order to further promote the philosophy of trust-based dialogue in international relations, Turkmenistan intends to propose a draft resolution on dialogue as a guarantor of peace for the General Assembly’s consideration. We are convinced that the adoption of such a document would confirm the principled and unequivocal commitment of all United Nations Member States to a peaceful, negotiation-based method of resolving conflict situations, no matter how difficult they might seem. Building further on our efforts in that direction, we invite the international community to declare 2025 the year of peace and trust, based on the provisions of resolution 73/338, adopted at the initiative of Turkmenistan.
Today the role of peacekeeping instruments in the international community’s toolkit is objectively increasing. That includes in particular using the potential of neutrality and its conceptual foundations to strengthen overall stability and security. Based on the recognition by the General Assembly of neutrality as a factor in strengthening comp peace and security and resolution 71/275, proclaiming 12 December International Day of Neutrality, Turkmenistan will continue to work actively with partners to expand the membership of the United Nations Group of Friends of Neutrality for Peace, Security and Sustainable Development.
The logic of the development of global processes in the field of security dictates the need for a radical strengthening of the mechanisms of regional interaction. On 28 July, the General Assembly adopted resolution 76/299, proclaiming Central Asia a zone of peace, trust and cooperation. We are grateful to the international community for that decision, which creates the necessary conditions in a strategically important part of the political map of the world for carrying out active efforts to strengthen international security, prevent and resolve conflicts, and build strong and effective regional institutions to that end.
As the host country of the headquarters of the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia, Turkmenistan urges the provision of all possible assistance to its work, which has proven its effectiveness. Given that December 2022 will mark the fifteenth anniversary of the establishment of the Regional Centre, we intend to submit to the General Assembly a draft resolution on the role of the Centre, reflecting the significant events of recent years and consolidating the mechanisms of regional interaction built on its basis.
We are particularly concerned about the currently rise in threats to global food security, which are rapidly beginning to affect an increasing number of countries and entire regions. In these conditions, urgent efforts and effective measures are required of the entire world community to overcome the current situation. In order to maintain the stability of the global food market, to jointly search for solutions to the complex problems of providing food to the most vulnerable countries, and to support the efforts of the Secretary-General to that end, we propose to hold an international forum on food security in Turkmenistan.
In the current context, it is especially important to fully deliver on the agreements reached on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) . In that regard, in support of the multilateral tools for monitoring the achievement of the SDGs, Turkmenistan will submit its second voluntary national review on the implementation of the SDGs during the High-level Political Forum in 2023.
At present, meeting the challenge of sustainable development will largely depend on the level of international cooperation in such critical areas as transport and energy. Pursuing its efforts to promote multilateral transport cooperation, at the current session Turkmenistan intends to summarize the results of the 2016 and 2021 United Nations Global Sustainable Transport Conferences and other high-level transport forums held in recent years, including the Ministerial Transportation Conference of Landlocked Developing Countries, held in Turkmenistan on 15 and 16 August, and to prepare proposals for the development of a draft concept for a special interregional United Nations programme for transport development.
At the current session, Turkmenistan also counts on the logical continuation of a broad dialogue on the problem of energy security. In that context, we consider it necessary, based on the provisions of General Assembly resolutions on the reliability and stability of energy resource supplies to world markets, adopted at the initiative of our country, to continue working on the implementation of Turkmenistan’s earlier proposals on the establishment of an international open-ended expert group to develop a modern international legal United Nations toolkit to regulate sustainable and reliable energy transit.
In Central Asia, due to objective reasons, climate change and water issues are of critical importance and, in some cases, determining factors in the development of regional processes, with a significant impact on the general situation, the implementation of socioeconomic development plans and efforts to address serious environmental issues.
Based on the positions of Turkmenistan on climate change adaptation and mitigation, presented in November 2021 at the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Glasgow, as well as those practically considered in multilateral consultations within the framework of the Bonn Climate Change Conference in Bonn in June, Turkmenistan is conducting preparatory work for the establishment in Ashgabat of a regional centre for climate technology for the countries of Central Asia.
At the same time, noting the nationally determined contribution of Turkmenistan, adopted in May 2022 in the context of fulfilling its obligations under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, Turkmenistan intends to step up its efforts to achieve the goals outlined in that document, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the promotion of the Global Methane Pledge initiative.
We will make persistent and determined efforts to single out the Aral Sea problem a dedicated area of work within the United Nations. To that end, in May 2023 we intend to resume negotiations on a draft resolution of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific on the establishment of a special United Nations programme for the Aral Sea basin, which will be based on the provisions of resolutions 72/273 and 73/297, on cooperation between the United Nations and the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea, adopted in 2018 and 2019, respectively.
The impact of the pandemic requires us to pursue our coordinated efforts to address identified vulnerabilities in global and national health systems. Turkmenistan will continue to support the joint activities of the international community to combat the novel coronavirus infection and create tools for medical diplomacy. Emphasizing the key role of the World Health Organization in developing consolidated responses to common challenges, we support the global One Health concept and will promote it as part of the Roadmap for Health and Well-Being in Central Asia 2022-2025.
Despite the diversity of the challenges facing each of our countries, we are united by common hopes, anxieties and threats. Turkmenistan is ready, together with its partners, to seek new approaches and ways to overcome the challenges faced by humanity. Based on strategic cooperation with the United Nations, our country will make every effort to achieve these goals."
Uganda,UGA,Africa,"  42,729,000 ",1909,2.104000092,4.3,62.973,Neonatal Disorder,HIV/AIDS,Cardiovascular Disease,2033,4.76,"  17,977,978 ",42.07,4.34,"I congratulate the President of the General Assembly on his election to preside over the Assembly at its seventy-seventh session and assure him of Uganda’s full support. I would like to thank His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid for his stewardship of the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session. I pay tribute to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, for his commitment to the work of the United Nations.
The seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly is being held in person for the first time since 2020, when the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic made it impossible to do so. It is a timely reminder of the urgent need to strengthen international cooperation, collaboration and solidarity so that the world may take transformative actions to address the common challenges that include, inter alia, poverty, health, pandemics, climate change, food insecurity and biodiversity loss.
As we celebrate 77 years of the United Nations, we need a revitalized Organization that is fit for purpose. We need our Organization to be stronger than ever before. We believe that multilateralism is fundamental and crucial in addressing our common challenges. We believe that, by acting together in solidarity as nations, the world can effectively address the current and emerging challenges. Responding to COVID-19 has taught us a lot. We should scale up cooperation in vaccine production capacity and resource mobilization in order to support efforts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are thankful to our bilateral and multilateral partners that supported our response to the COVID-19 challenge.
The Government of Uganda attaches importance to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and continues to register progress in its implementation. It has continued to strengthen its institutional coordination to achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and its national SDG secretariat has been strengthened to support the coordination architecture in order to ensure that the country stays on track in implementing the SDGs. The Government of Uganda has fully mainstreamed the SDGs in its national development plan and is working together with the United Nations family and other stakeholders. That will sustain and strengthen collaboration with all actors. However, the effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda will require support in areas such as transfer of technology, capacity-building and financing.
Climate change remains one of the greatest challenges of our time. Our collective effort to fight climate change is an irreversible process that must continue. However, we must note that, despite contributing an insignificant amount of global greenhouse-gas emissions, the African continent, like many developing regions of the world, suffers the effects of climate change to a disproportionate degree. Uganda, for instance, continues to experience prolonged droughts and the melting of ice caps on its highest mountain, Mount Rwenzori, as well as floods, erratic rainfall patterns and landslides.
Moreover, as His Excellency President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni has said before, the climate change problem is also the result of irresponsible and sometimes greedy human actions. Similarly, if underdevelopment persists, we can forget about conserving the environment. It is regrettable and hypocritical that some of the regions and nations that mismanaged the environment and are disproportionately responsible for global warming have embarked on a rigorous campaign to thwart the efforts of other countries to responsibly and sustainably develop their oil and gas sectors. Our view is that development should be environmentally friendly, inclusive and provide benefits for all — it should leave no one behind.
Uganda has continued to scale up investments in climate adaptation and mitigation measures, specifically with regard to increasing access to clean energy in
order to enhance production, as well as increasing forest and wetland cover, among other interventions. Climate change action must uphold the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and be consistent with a country’s national context. We therefore urge developed countries to fully deliver, in line with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, on the commitments to the goal of providing $100 billion per year to assist developing countries in the climate change actions they take to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change.
South-South cooperation, a framework of international cooperation within the global South, continues to play a vital role in supporting developing countries in their efforts to address interlocking challenges. We applaud the countries of the global South for their solidarity in responding to global challenges. Uganda will continue to work towards and support the strengthening of North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation at the United Nations. As host country of the third South Summit, to be held in Kampala from 10 to 12 December 2023, we look forward to welcoming the leaders of the Group of 77 and China.
The world currently faces many challenges that undermine international peace and security. The Russia-Ukraine military conflict continues to cause more suffering, destruction and displacement of the civilian population, mostly women and children. The longer it persists, the more suffering, destruction and displacement we will witness. We are deeply concerned about the loss of life and the serious humanitarian situation. Uganda supports dialogue with a view to reaching a peaceful resolution to the crisis. My President has said many times that,
“We think the best way is to negotiate. Everybody
who wants peace in the world should support
negotiations in order to get a balanced peace that
ensures safety for all.”
Terrorism is currently one of the major global threats to peace, security, stability and social and economic development. No region of the world has been safe from the scourge of terrorism. Terrorism and violent extremism continue to bring death and suffering to innocent people. Terrorist groups such as Al-Shabaab and the Allied Democratic Forces continue to commit terrorist acts in our region. As a community of nations, we must be unwavering in our resolve to prevent and combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.
We should act in a coordinated manner at the national, regional and global levels to counter that threat. Uganda will continue to support and actively participate in global and regional counterterrorism efforts.
Peace, security and development are inextricably linked and should be pursued simultaneously. Recently, we have seen some progress in our quest for peace and security in our region. Uganda, working with partners in the region and beyond, continues to support and advance peace and security efforts in the region. We remain actively involved in regional initiatives, such as those of the African Union, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the East African Community and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, and we are encouraged by the progress that we have made and continue to make. We believe that long-term and sustainable solutions lie in those collaborative processes. The international community, in particular the United Nations, should therefore continue to support conflict-prevention initiatives undertaken by those regional and subregional organizations. Experience has shown that, when and where that has happened, the chances of success have been high.
The conflicts in our region and beyond have led to an inevitable refugee influx into Uganda. Currently, we have more than 1.5 million refugees in the country — the largest refugee population on the continent of Africa and the third-largest in the world. We are committed to working with refugee-sending countries and regional and international partners to address the causes of the refugee crisis. We urge the international community to continue supporting our efforts in the region in that direction.
The need to reform the Security Council is now more urgent and imperative than ever before. The current geopolitical realities make an increasingly compelling case for a comprehensive reform of the Council to make way for equitable representation. Africa, which has more than 1 billion citizens and accounts for more than 70 per cent of the issues on the agenda of the Council, continues to suffer the historical injustice of having no representation in the permanent category of Security Council membership — and is also underrepresented in the non-permanent category. It is time for the long-standing injustice and imbalance perpetuated in the current configuration of the Security Council to be addressed. Uganda supports the comprehensive reform of the Council and urges Member States to continue working towards achieving progress in the
intergovernmental negotiations so that Africa can assume its rightful place in the Security Council.
The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries (NAM) remains a strong pillar in addressing global challenges within the United Nations. We remain actively involved in NAM, in line with its purposes and principles. In that regard, Uganda will continue to collectively work with other NAM countries to further strengthen the critical role of the Movement at the United Nations. As host of the nineteenth NAM Summit, to be held in Kampala from 5 to 9 December 2023, we look forward to welcoming the leaders of the Non-Aligned Movement."
Ukraine,UKR,Europe,"  44,246,000 ",9694,9.454999924,4.7,71.953,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,9517,21.51,"  44,246,000 ",100.00,9.87,"Greetings to all people of the world who value peace and unity between different and equal nations! I wish you all peace!
I thank you that we are united in our striving to restore peace and to guarantee peace for any nation that has become a victim of the armed aggression.
A crime has been committed against Ukraine, and we demand just punishment.
The crime was committed against our state borders. The crime was committed against the lives of our people. The crime was committed against the dignity of our women and men.
The crime was committed against the values that make you and me a community of the United Nations.
And Ukraine demands punishment for trying to steal our territory. Punishment for the murders of thousands of people. Punishment for tortures and humiliations of women and men.
Punishment for the catastrophic turbulence that Russia provoked with its illegal war and not only for us, Ukrainians, but for the whole world. For every nation that is represented in this Hall of the UN General Assembly.
I am speaking on behalf of the state, which is forced to defend itself, but has the formula for peace. I am speaking to everyone who wants to hear how to achieve peace.
I will present a formula that can work not only for us, but for anyone who may find themselves in similar circumstances as we did. It is a formula that punishes crime, protects life, restores security and territorial integrity, guarantees security, and provides determination.
There are five preconditions for peace.
Dear Mr. President of the General Assembly!
Dear Secretary-General of the United Nations!
Dear heads of states and governments!
Dear journalists!
Nations of the world!
Ukraine wants peace. Europe wants peace. The world wants peace. And we have seen who is THE ONLY ONE who wants war.
There is only one entity among all UN Member States who would say now, if he could interrupt my speech, that he is happy with this war — with his war. But we will not let this entity prevail over us, even though it is the largest state in the world.
Ukraine showed strength on the battlefield, using its right to self-defense in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter. And no one will reproach us now or in the future with weakness or inability to fight for ourselves, for our independence.
We are achieving a result in this fight and we see what the end of this war will be, and what will be the guarantees of a stable peace.
The UN Charter proclaims the equality of nations — and we proved that Ukraine is equal among the equals.
The UN Charter protects the inviolability of borders — and we confirm our state borderline by expelling the occupiers outside.
The UN Charter stipulates the value of human rights, dignity and life, and we also stipulate them — with every Ukrainian city freed from Russian occupation.
We did not provoke this war. We held 88 rounds of talks in various formats to prevent this war, just from the beginning of my presidency until February 24 this year.
But Russia — instead of stopping the crime of aggression, which it started back in 2014 — turned it into a full-scale invasion. And we have no choice but to defend ourselves. We do it. We push the aggressor beyond the internationally recognized border of the Ukrainian state.
And this is the first item of our peace formula. Comprehensive item. Punishment.
Punishment for the crime of aggression. Punishment for violation of borders and territorial integrity. Punishment that must be in place until the internationally recognized border is restored. Until the aggression stops. And until the damages and losses for the war are fully compensated.
Therefore, sanctions against the aggressor are a part of the peace formula. Blocking the trade and relations with the aggressor is a part of the peace formula. All this is a punishment.
So long as the aggressor is a party to decision-making in the international organizations, he must be isolated from them — at least until aggression lasts. Reject the right to vote. Deprive delegation rights. Remove the right of veto — if it is a Member of the UN Security Council. In order to punish the aggressor within the institutions.
We should not turn a blind eye to propagandists who justify aggression, but apply a full package of personal restrictions against them. That is a punishment for lying.
Citizens of the aggressor state should not be allowed to enjoy tourism or shopping in the territory of those who value peace, but should be encouraged through visa restrictions to fight against the aggression of their own state. Punish for abetting the evil.
A Special Tribunal should be created to punish Russia for the crime of aggression against our state. This will become signal to all “would-be” aggressors, that they must value peace or be brought to responsibility by the world.
We have prepared precise steps to establish such Tribunal. They will be presented to all states.
Ukraine will appeal to the UN General Assembly to support an international compensation mechanism.
We count on your support.
Russia should pay for this war with its assets. It is also a punishment. This is one of the most terrible punishments for Russian officials, who value money above everything else.
The second item of the peace formula is the protection of life. The most concrete item.
Now, while the sessions of the General Assembly continue, in the Ukrainian town of Izyum, Kharkiv region, the exhumation is under way ... of bodies from a mass burial, which happened when the territory was controlled by Russian troops. The bodies of women and men, children and adults, civilians and soldiers were found there. 445 graves.
There is a family that died under the rubble of a house after a Russian airstrike — father, mother, 6- and 8-year-old girls, grandparents. There is a man who was strangled with a rope. There is a woman with broken ribs and wounds on her body. There is a man who was castrated before the murder, and this is not the first case.
Ask, please, the representatives of Russia why the Russian military are so obsessed with castration. What was done to them so that they want to do this to others?
The only thing that differs the mass burial in Izyum from what the world saw in Bucha is, in fact, the burial. The Russian army was in Izyum for a longer time, and therefore the bodies of the killed people were buried, and not scattered on the streets.
So, how can we allow the Russian army somewhere on Ukrainian soil, knowing that they are committing such mass murders everywhere? We cannot.
We must protect life. The world must protect life. Every state suffering the armed aggression needs the opportunity to protect its citizens and liberate its territory.
If it requires help with weapons or shells — they should be provided. If you need financial help for this, it should be given. If for this, it is necessary to help with the intelligence data —just do it. But what is not needed, is lies.
We can return the Ukrainian flag to our entire territory. We can do it with the force of arms.
But we need time.
We tried to speed it up. We tried to implement the basic provisions of the UN Charter for Ukraine through negotiations.
But Russia is afraid of real negotiations and does not want to fulfill any fair international obligations. It lies to everyone. As it is typical for aggressors, for terrorists.
Even now, when Russia talks about negotiations, it only wants to slow down its retreat. Russia wants to spend the winter on the occupied territory of Ukraine and prepare forces to attempt a new offensive. New Buchas, new Izyums ... Or at least it wants to prepare fortifications on occupied land and carry out military mobilization at home.
We cannot agree to a delayed war. Because it will be even hotter than the war now.
For us, this is a war for life. That is why we need defense support — weapons, military equipment and shells. Offensive weapons, a long-range one is enough to liberate our land, and defensive systems, above all, air defense. And we need financial support — to keep internal stability and fulfill social obligations to our people.
Physical and social protection are two elements of any nation’s life. So, the second item of our peace formula is the protection of life. By all available means — allowed by the UN Charter.
The third item of our peace formula is restoring security and territorial integrity.
Look at how many elements of global security Russia has undermined with its war — maritime safety, food safety, radiation safety, energy safety and safety from weapons of mass destruction.
We are already restoring maritime safety and food security. And I thank Mr. Antonio Guterres for his personal involvement. Algeria, Ethiopia, Egypt, Libya, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Tunisia, Bangladesh, Israel, India, Iran, Yemen, Cyprus, China, Korea, Lebanon, Tiirkiye, Belgium, Bulgaria, Greece, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Germany, Romania and France have already received Ukrainian agricultural products.
And we have to increase the supply by sea. Both under market conditions and within the UN Food Program, for which Ukraine is always a reliable partner.
By the way, despite all the difficulties caused by the war, we decided to provide humanitarian aid to Ethiopia and Somalia, so we will send them an additional amount of our wheat.
But it is more difficult with other security elements.
On the eve of the General Assembly meeting, Russia fired missiles at the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant. The explosion hit the station buildings — windows were broken, walls were damaged. The rockets exploded only three hundred meters from the walls of the reactors!
And this is after the IAEA’s clear appeal to Russia to stop any hostile activity against any nuclear facilities of Ukraine and, in particular, against the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station — the largest one in Europe, which Russia has turned into a target.
And that makes all of you a target.
Russian radiation blackmailing is something that should concern each and every one of you, because none of you will find a vaccine against radiation sickness.
The cost-of-living crisis continues in dozens of countries, it roots in the destabilization of the energy market. It is necessary to remove the main factor of global price turbulence, namely: Russian energy blackmailing.
It is necessary to cap the prices at which Russia exports its energy re-sources. It is necessary to make Russian oil and gas —just ordinary goods again. Currently, oil and gas are Russia’s energy weapons. And that is why it manipulates the markets so that electricity, gas, petrol and diesel become the privilege of few instead of being a common good available to all.
Limiting prices is safeguarding the world. This is the way to restore energy and price security.
But will the world go for it? Or will it be scared? Will it be scared of Russian threats?
It is necessary to take only one strong step, after which everything will become clear. The time has come for this.
This step will put everything in place. After the Russian missile terror. After the massacres. After Mariupol. After the burning of Ukrainian prisoners in Olenivka by the Russian military. After blocking the ports. After the strikes of Russian tanks and missiles on nuclear power plants. And after threats to use nuclear weapons, which have become the rule, not the exception, for Russian propagandists ...
We must finally recognize Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. At all levels. In all countries that confess the values of peace and protection of human life. Legally. Politically.
If you don’t have a legal mechanism, you can make a political decision — in the parliaments. This is the foundation for restoring global security. If this strong step is taken, doubts will disappear — whether to take other important steps.
And what is very sensitive — is the border, the territorial integrity.
When one country tries to steal the territory of another state, it puts all world nations under attack.
Global security cannot be restored without restoring the territorial integrity of the nation which suffered the armed aggression.
So, the third item of the Ukrainian peace formula is the restoration of security and territorial integrity. The fourth item is security guarantees.
Every nation has the right to security guarantees. Not only the largest nations. Not only the most fortunate ones.
We have proposals to upgrade the security architecture for Ukraine, and for Europe and the world, which will not allow any more aggression against us. We are already presenting them to partners.
Proposals for legally binding multilateral and bilateral treaties. These are the conditions for the guarantors to act, and the timeline for their actions to bring results — results on land, at sea and in the air; in diplomacy and politics, in economy and finance, in providing weapons and intelligence. Each of you, who will receive the text of our peace formula will also see the details of what we offer as security guarantees.
I do not want to compare our offers with the guarantees of any alliances that exist on the planet now. I want to stress that it is always much better to guarantee the security of a nation, preventively, rather than to stop a war after it has already begun.
And the fifth item of the Ukrainian peace formula is determination. Something without which the other four items will not work.
This is our determination to fight. This is the determination of the partners to help us, and also themselves. And this is the determination of the world to unite around the one who fights against armed aggression and to call to order the one who threatens all.
So, all five items of our formula:
punishment for aggression;
protection of life;
restoration of security and territorial integrity;
security guarantees;
and determination to defend oneself.
This is the formula of crime and punishment, which is already well known to Russia. And this is the formula of justice and law and order that Russia has yet to learn. As well as any other potential aggressors.
What is not in our formula? Neutrality.
Those who speak of neutrality, when human values and peace are under attack, mean something else. They talk about indifference — everyone for themselves. Here’s what they say. They pretend to be interested in each other’s problems. They take care of each other formally. They sympathize only for protocol. And that is why they pretend to protect someone, but in reality, they protect only their vested interests. This is what creates the conditions for war. This is what needs to be corrected in order to create conditions for peace.
All you need is determination.
There was a lot of talking about reforming the UN. How did it all end? No result.
If you look carefully at our peace formula, you will see that its implementation is already becoming a de facto reform of the United Nations. Our formula is universal, and unites the North and the South of the world. It calls for the world’s majority, and encourages to expand the representation of those who remained unheard.
This is an imbalance when Africa, Latin America, most of Asia, Central and Eastern Europe comply with the right of veto, that they themselves never had.
And this is what Ukraine is talking about. And have you ever heard such words from Russia? But it is a permanent member of the Security Council. For some reason. For what reason, not Japan or Brazil, not Tiirkiye or India, not Germany or Ukraine. The day will come when this will be resolved.
As for the talks between Ukraine and Russia.
Probably you have happened to hear different words from Russia about the talks — as if they were ready for them. But. They talk about the talks but announce military mobilization. They talk about the talks but announce pseudo referendums in the occupied territories.
What is true then? The military mobilization in Russia is true. Sham referendums are also true. Russia wants war. It’s true. But Russia will not be able to stop the course of history. Mankind and the international law are stronger than one terrorist state. Russia will be forced to end this war. The war it has started.
I rule out that the settlement can happen on a different basis than the Ukrainian peace formula. The further the Russian terror reaches, the less likely it is that anyone in the world will agree to sit at one table with them.
And if my words will be followed by new Russian missiles and acts of terrorism it will only prove the weakness. Russia’s weakness. Its inability to prevail over us, its inability to prevail over the world.
It will only prove that 5 items of the Ukrainian peace formula must be implemented as soon as possible.
We are ready for peace. But true, honest and fair peace. That’s why the world is on our side.
And finally.
I want to thank one hundred and one countries that voted for my video address to take place. It was a vote not only about the format. It was the vote about principles.
Only seven countries voted against: Belarus, Cuba, North Korea, Eritrea, Nicaragua, Russia and Syria.
Seven who are afraid of the video address. Seven who respond to principles with a red button. Only seven.
One hundred and one — and seven.
Friends! — if this coalition is against our determination, then I congratulate you all. Because this means that peace will prevail over any aggression, and that there is no Obstacle for us to implement the peace formula.
I thank you for your attention!
Once again, I wish you all peace!"
United Arab Emirates,ARE,Asia,"  9,631,000 ",70284,1.672000051,6.6,77.814,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Road Injuries,628,6.52,"  9,631,000 ",100.00,9.65,"I would like to thank His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid for his outstanding management of the work of the General Assembly at its previous session. I would also like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi on his assumption of the presidency of the Assembly at this session, and I wish him every success.
At the threshold of a new era for the world order, the United Arab Emirates has chosen to embrace peace, recovery and prosperity within an open global system based on a robust network of international relations providing new tracks for joint cooperation in the fields of economics, sustainable development, advanced technology and scientific research. That is the approach adopted by my country in the implementation of its foreign policy, which governs our bilateral relations and multilateral engagements in general and is guiding us throughout our current membership in the Security Council.
We are well aware, however, of the magnitude of the significant challenges before us today, as well as the increasing level of polarization that looms over the international system. That is the result of a growing number of crises and new conflict hotspots around the world, together with a dangerous escalation in the activities of armed groups while people around the world are suffering immensely from food and climate crises. Those challenges not only threaten the gains made by humankind, but they also have a severe impact on poor and developing countries and their ability to meet the needs of their peoples.
Such issues call into question the effectiveness of the current international order. However, it is that very system, which was built on the ruins of the Second World War, that has significantly contributed to strengthened international security and stability. What we need today is to restore confidence in the existing international
system and the legitimacy of its institutions through enhancing its efficiency and building its capabilities to address the current crises and overcome the existential challenges of the twenty-first century. The United Arab Emirates believes that, together, all the countries present in this Hall, with the requisite determination, can achieve those ends by combining our capabilities to chart a better future for our peoples. Accordingly, I would like to emphasize a number of issues that demand our attention in the coming period.
Recent developments underscore the need to respect international law, in particular, the United Nations Charter. That law must be applied consistently without double standards or selectivity, which is imperative for achieving stability and security in our international order — an order based on respect for the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of States. In that context, we reiterate our demand for an end to Iran’s occupation of the three United Arab Emirates islands — Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa — whose United Arab Emirates sovereignty has been proven by history and international law. Despite the sincere calls of my country to peacefully resolve this conflict over the past five decades, we note that Iran has not responded. However, we will never relent in voicing our legitimate right over those islands, whether through direct negotiations or through the International Court of Justice.
We must spare no effort to overcome the fatigue that has become the most obvious characteristic of current international approaches to addressing crises. We need to find permanent, comprehensive and fair solutions to the escalating armed conflicts around the world and to address the repercussions of turmoil on the international scene. Therefore, the next stage requires us to adopt innovative solutions in order to enhance the effectiveness of our international system and enable countries and regions with conflicts to play a constructive role in addressing the challenges of our era.
For decades, the Arab world and African continent have been hit hardest by crises. As a direct result, we have learned difficult yet critical lessons. We must prioritize diplomatic solutions, dialogue and de-escalation in order to ease tensions, prevent new conflicts from emerging and combat extremist ideologies.
The recent positive developments in our region aimed at building bridges are prominent examples of overcoming previous differences and forging new partnerships based on cooperation in various fields and supporting critical sectors such as health, education and industry, as well as strengthening the role of women.
We stress our firm position on the establishment of an independent Palestinian State on the borders of 4 June 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital, in accordance with the agreed international terms of reference. We welcome the affirmation by the Prime Minister of the State of Israel in his statement from this rostrum regarding support for the vision of the two- State solution (see A/77/PV.8).
We also look forward to advancing all political processes in our region and paving pathways to peace. However, that should be complemented by strengthening the united international position that rejects interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries. That type of interference undermines conflict resolution, fuels extremism and terrorism and constitutes a flagrant violation of the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of States.
In the light of the increasing frequency of crises, it becomes imperative to enhance the role of regional and international organizations by holding consultations and providing them with the necessary tools, resources and expertise in order to enable them to effectively respond to current challenges. Regional organizations are more familiar with local contexts and better positioned to support mediation efforts. We have seen that repeatedly, including through the efforts of the African Union, whose initiatives we applaud and support.
As we all know, the maintenance of international peace and security requires a world free of weapons of mass destruction, particularly in the Middle East and the Korean peninsula. It also requires promoting dialogue to reduce tensions and to address regional and international concerns in that regard.
It is impossible to speak of a secure and stable international order in the absence of a firm international position rejecting terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and committed to holding the perpetrators and financers of terrorism accountable. Recently we have seen an increase in the flow of weapons and fighters of different backgrounds into conflict zones, in addition to the emergence of groups with high combat and military capabilities. Those fighters subsequently return to their countries of origin without having mechanisms to control them. In addition, the situation becomes increasingly dangerous owing to terrorists’ use of missiles and drones to launch cross-border attacks.
Those developments reflect the evolving nature of terrorism and require efforts to prevent conflict zones from becoming a safe haven for terrorists and to update and develop means of deterrence and adopt international rules and regulations that prevent terrorists from obtaining advanced weapons and technology. That threat manifested itself clearly in the Houthi terrorist group’s heinous and hostile attacks earlier this year against the capital of my country, Abu Dhabi, as well as against the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. At the same time, other terrorist groups, such as Da’esh, Al-Qaida, and Al-Shabaab, seek to develop their capabilities and reorganize their ranks, which directly threaten the gains made as a result of international cooperation in the war against terrorism.
As Governments, we must lead our people by example by establishing the values of tolerance and peaceful coexistence in the face of increasing attempts to spread hate speech around the world. In addition, and in the light of humankind’s shared destiny, it is imperative that we acknowledge the need for joint action. We must harness our shared capabilities and energy to implement comprehensive solutions and responses that rise to the level of the existential challenges that we face today and are not limited to a specific country or region.
There is no clearer example of that than the implications of climate change. People around the world are exposed to devastating floods, heat waves and drought, all of which exacerbate humanitarian crises and security threats, especially in areas most vulnerable to climate change. All those facts confirm that the fate of our planet is at stake. We must therefore forge partnerships, promote joint action and commit to supporting climate action by adopting the renewable energy agenda, providing adequate funding for climate action and supporting developing countries in building resilient communities.
It has become clear that investing in renewable energy means investing in the economy, international peace and security and future generations. In that regard, we must take advantage of available opportunities to create practical, rational and thoughtful solutions to the climate crisis, including during the twenty-seventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in the sisterly Arab Republic of Egypt in November. We urge all Member States to actively engage in that meeting. While my country prepares to host the twenty-eighth session next year, we are working to build partnerships, ensure inclusivity and focus on areas in which we can achieve meaningful results to address the phenomenon of climate change.
Furthermore, focusing on climate change will relieve the food crisis around the world. The Agricultural Innovation Mission for Climate, launched by the United Arab Emirates in cooperation with the United States, aims to improve food production and reduce hunger levels around the world. Simultaneously, we must intensify food assistance to all peoples and ensure the continued flow of global food supplies, while also looking for practical ways to secure supply chains in the light of the current geopolitical divisions.
Despite the gravity of the current challenges and the importance of addressing them, we must not disregard the need to ensure long-term stability and prosperity. In that regard, my country is building a diversified, knowledge-based economy that relies on scientific and technological progress as well as peaceful and secure communities. Two years after Abraham Accords, several initiatives took place this year to promote regional integration and strengthen cooperation in the development and economic fields across our region. We are witnessing today the rise of a community for progress in the Middle East, which will bolster joint cooperation with regard to the major global priorities.
In young people we see the best ability to mobilize such efforts, as demonstrated by their resilience and innovation in the face of the current crises, as well as their unparalleled passion to connect with their peers around the world and find sustainable solutions to global challenges. We will therefore not give up on the potential of young people or our investment in them to ensure that they remain pillars and leaders of the future. We also believe that the full, equal and meaningful participation of women in various fields contributes to advancing societies, thereby ensuring their stability now and in the future.
In conclusion, the United Arab Emirates reiterates that it will continue its approach to humanitarian, diplomatic and development support for all peoples affected by crises and disasters, regardless of their religion, ethnicity, political affiliation or culture. We will continue to work with all friends and partners to build the capabilities and capacities of Governments and peoples across all fields for the universal common good. That approach remains the beacon of our efforts throughout all forums."
United Kingdom,GBR,Europe,"  67,142,000 ",39162,4.329999924,7.2,81.236,Neoplasm,Cardiovascular Disease,Dementia,5325,7.93,"  67,142,000 ",100.00,11.54,"At the time of its foundation, the United Nations was a beacon of promise. In the aftermath of the Second World War, the building we are in symbolized the end of aggression. For many decades, the United Nations has helped to deliver stability and security in much of the world. It has provided a place for nations to work together on shared challenges, and it has promoted the principles of sovereignty and self-determination even through the Cold War and its aftermath. But today those principles, which have defined our lives since the dark days of the 1940s, are fracturing. For the first time in the history of the General Assembly, we are meeting during a large-scale war of aggression in Europe, and authoritarian States are undermining stability and security around the world. Geopolitics is entering a new era that requires those who believe in the founding
principles of the United Nations to stand up and be counted.
In the United Kingdom, we are entering a new era too. I am joining everyone here just two days after Her late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II was laid to rest. We deeply mourn her passing, and we pay tribute to her service. She was the rock on which modern Britain was built, and she symbolized the post-war values on which the Organization was founded. Our constitutional monarchy, underpinned by a democratic society, has delivered stability and progress. Her late Majesty transcended differences and healed division. We saw that in her visits to post-apartheid South Africa and the Republic of Ireland.
When she addressed this General Assembly 65 years ago (see A/PV.707), she warned that it was vital not only to have strong ideals but also the political will to deliver on them. Now we must show that will. We must fight to defend those ideals. And we must deliver on them for all our peoples. As we say farewell to our late Queen, the United Kingdom opens a new chapter — a new Carolean age — under His Majesty King Charles III. We want this era to be one of hope and progress; one in which we defend the values of individual liberty, self-determination and equality before the law; one in which we ensure that freedom and democracy prevail for all people; and one in which we deliver on the commitments that our late Queen made here 65 years ago. This is about what we do in the United Kingdom and what we do as States Members of the United Nations.
I will therefore set out today the steps we are taking at home in the United Kingdom, our proposed blueprint for the new era we are now in and the new partnerships and instruments that we should collectively adopt. Our commitment to hope and progress must begin at home, in the lives of each and every citizen whom we serve. Our strength as a nation comes from the strong foundations of freedom and democracy. Democracy gives people the right to choose their own path, and it evolves to reflect the aspirations of citizens. It unleashes enterprise, ideas and opportunity. It protects the freedoms that are at the very core of our humanity. By contrast, autocracies sow the seeds of their own demise by suppressing their citizens. They are fundamentally rigid and unable to adapt. Any short-term gains are eroded in the long term because such societies stifle the aspiration and creativity that are vital to long-term growth. A country where artificial intelligence acts as judge and jury and where there are no human rights and no fundamental freedoms is not the kind of place where anyone truly wants to live, and it is not the kind of world we want to build.
But we cannot simply assume there will be a democratic future. There is a real struggle going on between different forms of society, between democracies and autocracies. Unless democratic societies deliver on the economy and security that our citizens expect, we will fall behind. We need to keep improving and renewing what we are doing for this new era, demonstrating that democracy delivers. As Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, I am determined that we will deliver the progress that people expect. I will lead a new Britain for a new era.
First, that begins with growth and building a British economy that rewards enterprise and attracts investment. Our long-term aim is to get our economy growing at an average of 2.5 per cent. We need that growth to deliver investment around our country, the jobs and high wages that people expect and public services like the National Health Service. We want people to keep more of the money they earn so that they can have more control over their own lives and can contribute to the future.
Secondly, it means securing affordable and reliable energy supplies. We are cutting off the toxic power and pipelines from authoritarian regimes and strengthening our energy resilience. We will ensure that we cannot be coerced or harmed by the reckless actions of rogue actors abroad. We will transition to a future based on renewable and nuclear energy, while ensuring that the gas used during that transition is from reliable sources, including our own North Sea production. We will be a net energy exporter by 2040.
Thirdly, we are safeguarding the security of our economy — the supply chains, the critical minerals, the food and the technology that drive growth and protect people’s lives and health. We will not be strategically dependent on those who seek to weaponize the global economy. Instead, we are reforming our economy to get Britain moving, and we want to work with our allies so that we can all move forward together. The free world needs that economic strength and resilience to push back against authoritarian aggression and win this new era of strategic competition. We must do that together. We are therefore building new partnerships around the world. We are fortifying our deep security alliances
in Europe and beyond through NATO and the Joint Expeditionary Force. We are deepening our links with fellow democracies such as India, Israel, Indonesia and South Africa. We are building new security ties with our friends in the Indo-Pacific region and the Gulf. We have shown leadership on free and fair trade, striking trade agreements with Australia, New Zealand, Japan and many others. We are also in the process of acceding to the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Rather than exerting influence through debt, aggression and control of critical infrastructure and minerals, we are building strategic ties based on mutual benefit and trust, and we are deepening partnerships such as the Group of Seven and the Commonwealth. We must also collectively extend a hand of friendship to the parts of the world that have too often been left behind and left vulnerable to global challenges, whether that is the Pacific or Caribbean island States dealing with the impact of climate change, or the countries of the Western Balkans facing persistent threats to their stability. The United Kingdom is providing funding, using the might of the City of London and our security capabilities to provide better alternatives to those offered by malign regimes.
The resolute international response to Ukraine has shown how we can deliver decisive collective action. The response has been built on partnerships and alliances, as well as on being prepared to use new instruments, including unprecedented sanctions, diplomatic action and rapid military support. There has been a strength of collective purpose. We have met many times, spoken many times on the phone and made things happen. Now we must use those instruments in a more systematic way to push back on the economic aggression of authoritarian regimes.
The G-7 and our like-minded partners should act as an economic NATO, collectively defending our prosperity. If the economy of a partner is being targeted by an aggressive regime, we should act to support that partner — all for one and one for all. Through the G-7’s $600 billion Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, we provide an honest and reliable alternative for infrastructure investment around the world, free from debt with strings attached. We must go further to friend-shore our supply chains and end strategic dependence. That is how we will build collective security, strengthen our resilience and safeguard freedom and democracy.
Nevertheless, we cannot let up on dealing with the crisis we face today. No one is threatening Russia. Yet, as we meet here today, barbarous weapons are being used to kill and maim people in Ukraine. Rape is being used as an instrument of war. Families are being torn apart. Earlier today, we saw Putin desperately try to justify his catastrophic failures. He is doubling down by sending even more reservists to a terrible fate. He is desperately trying to claim the mantle of democracy for a regime without human rights or freedoms. He is making yet more bogus claims and sabre-rattling threats. That will not work. The international alliance is strong, and Ukraine is strong.
The contrast between Russia’s conduct and Ukraine’s brave, dignified First Lady, Olena Zelenska, who is here at the United Nations today, could not be more stark. Ukrainians are not just defending their own country, they are defending our values and the security of the whole world. That is why we must act. That is why the United Kingdom will spend 3 per cent of GDP on defence by 2030, thereby maintaining our position as the leading security actor in Europe. That is why at this crucial moment in the conflict, I pledge that we will sustain or increase our military support to Ukraine, for as long as it takes. New weapons from the United Kingdom are arriving in Ukraine as I speak, including more multiple launch rocket system rockets. We will not rest until Ukraine prevails.
In all of those areas, on all of those fronts, the time to act is now. This is a decisive moment in our history — in the history of the Organization and in the history of freedom. The story of 2022 could have been that of an authoritarian State rolling its tanks over the border of a peaceful neighbour and subjugating its people. Instead, it is the story of freedom fighting back. In the face of rising aggression, we have shown that we have the power to act and the resolve to see it through. However, that must not be a one-off. It must be a new era in which we commit to ourselves, our citizens and this institution that we will do whatever it takes — whatever it takes — to deliver for our people and defend our values.
As we mourn our late Queen and remember her call to the Assembly, we must devote ourselves to that task. Britain’s commitment to that is total. We will be a dynamic, reliable and trustworthy partner. Together with our friends and allies around the world, we will continue to champion freedom, sovereign and
democracy. Together, we can define this new era as one of hope and progress."
United States,USA,North America,"  327,096,000 ",53015,4.360000134,6.9,78.851,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,53099,16.23,"  327,096,000 ",100.00,10.56,"In the past year, our world experienced great upheaval: a growing crisis in food insecurity; record heat, floods and droughts; the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic; inflation; and a brutal, needless war — a war chosen by one man, to be very blunt.
Let me speak plainly. A permanent member of the Security Council invaded its neighbour and attempted to erase a sovereign State from the map. Russia shamelessly violated the core tenets of the Charter of the United Nations, none more important than the clear prohibition against countries taking the territory of their neighbour by force. Just today, President Putin once again made overt nuclear threats against Europe, in reckless disregard for the responsibilities of the non-proliferation regime. Now Russia is calling up more soldiers to join the fight, and the Kremlin is organizing sham referendums to try to annex parts of Ukraine, an extremely significant violation of the Charter. The world should see those outrageous acts for what they are.
Putin claims that he had to act because Russia was threatened. But no one threatened Russia, and no one other than Russia sought conflict. In fact, we warned it was coming, and we worked with many who are here today to try to avert it. Putin’s own words make his true purpose unmistakable. Just before he invaded, he asserted that Ukraine was “created by Russia” and had never had “real statehood”. And now we see attacks on schools, railway stations, hospitals and centres of Ukrainian history and culture.
We have just seen even more horrifying evidence of Russia’s atrocity crimes and war crimes; mass graves have been uncovered in Izyum. The bodies, according to those who excavated them, show signs of torture.
This war, plain and simple, is about extinguishing Ukraine’s right to exist as a State and as a people. Anyone, anywhere, regardless of what they believe — that should make their blood run cold. That is why 141 nations in the General Assembly came together to unequivocally condemn Russia’s war against Ukraine. The United States has marshalled massive amounts of security assistance, humanitarian aid and direct economic support for Ukraine — more than $25 billion to date.
Our allies and partners around the world have stepped up as well. More than 40 countries represented here have contributed billions of their own money and equipment to help Ukraine defend itself. The United States is also working closely with its allies and partners to impose costs on Russia, deter attacks against NATO territory and hold Russia accountable for the atrocities and war crimes. Because if nations can pursue their imperial ambitions without consequences, then we put at risk everything this very institution stands for — everything.
Every victory won on the battlefield belongs to the courageous Ukrainian soldiers. But this past year, the world was tested as well, and we did not hesitate. We chose liberty. We chose sovereignty. We chose principles to which every party to the Charter of the United Nations is beholding. We stood with Ukraine.
Like everyone here, the United States wants this war to end on just terms — terms we all signed up for — that a nation cannot seize the territory of another by force. The only country standing in the way of that is Russia. Therefore, we — all the members of the General Assembly who are determined to uphold the principles and beliefs we pledge to defend as States Members of the United Nations — must be clear, firm and unwavering in our resolve. Ukraine has the same rights that belong to every sovereign nation. We will stand in solidarity with Ukraine. We will stand in solidarity against Russia’s aggression — period.
It is no secret that, in the contest between democracy and autocracy, the United States — and I
as President — champion a vision for our world that is grounded in the values of democracy. The United States is determined to defend and strengthen democracy at home and around the world, because I believe that democracy remains humankind’s greatest instrument to address the challenges of our time. We are working with the Group of Seven and like-minded countries to prove that democracies can deliver both for their citizens and for the rest of the world.
But as we meet today, the Charter’s very basis of a stable and just rules-based order is under attack by those who wish to tear it down or distort it for their own political advantage. The United Nations Charter was not only signed by democracies of the world, but it was also negotiated among citizens of dozens of nations with vastly different histories and ideologies, united in their commitment to working for peace.
As President Truman said in 1945, the Charter of the United Nations is
“proof that nations, like men, can state their
differences, can face them, and then can find
common ground on which to stand”.
That common ground was so straightforward and basic that today 193 Member States have willingly embraced its principles. And standing up for those principles — for the Charter — is the job of every responsible Member State.
I reject the use of violence and war to conquer nations or expand borders through bloodshed. To stand against global politics of fear and coercion, to defend the sovereign rights of smaller nations as equal to those of larger ones and to embrace basic principles such as freedom of navigation, respect for international law and arms control — no matter what else we may disagree on, that is the common ground on which we must stand. The United States wants to work with all who are still committed to a strong foundation for the good of every nation around the world.
I also believe the time has come for this institution to become more inclusive so that it can better respond to the needs of today’s world. Members of the Security Council, including the United States, should consistently uphold and defend the Charter and refrain — I repeat — refrain from the use of the veto, except in rare, extraordinary situations, in order to ensure that the Council remains credible and effective. That is also why the United States supports increasing the number of both permanent and non-permanent representatives of the Council. That includes granting permanent seats to those nations we have long supported to receive them, as well as to countries in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.
The United States is committed to that vital work. In every region, we have pursued new, constructive ways to work with partners to advance shared interests — from elevating the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue in the Indo-Pacific and signing the Los Angeles Declaration of Migration and Protection at the Summit of the Americas, to joining a historic meeting of nine Arab leaders to work towards a more peaceful and integrated Middle East and hosting the United States- Africa Leaders Summit scheduled for December.
As I said last year (see A/76/PV.3), the United States is opening an era of relentless diplomacy to address the challenges that matter most to people’s lives — all people’s lives — including tackling the climate crisis, as the previous speaker spoke to; strengthening global health security; and feeding the world — I repeat — feeding the world. We made that our priority, and one year later we are keeping that promise.
From the day I came to office, we have led with a bold climate agenda. We rejoined the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, convened major climate summits, helped deliver critical agreements on the twenty- sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and helped get two thirds of the world’s gross domestic product on track in order to limit global warming to 1.5°C.
And now I have signed a historic piece of legislation here in the United States that includes the biggest, most important climate commitment we have ever made in the history of our country: $369 billion allocated to climate change. That includes allocating tens of billions of dollars for new investments in offshore wind and solar energy, doubling down on zero-emission vehicles, increasing energy efficiency and supporting clean manufacturing.
Our Department of Energy estimates that this new law will reduce United States emissions by one gigaton a year by 2030, while unleashing a new era of clean- energy-powered economic growth. Our investments will also help reduce the cost of developing clean- energy technologies worldwide, not just in the United States. That is a global game changer — and none too soon. We do not have much time.
We all know that we are already living in a climate crisis. No one seems to doubt it after this past year. As we meet, much of Pakistan is still under water. It needs help. Meanwhile, the Horn of Africa faces unprecedented drought. Families are facing impossible choices, choosing which child to feed and wondering whether they will survive. That is the human cost of climate change — and it is growing, not lessening.
Therefore, as I announced last year, in order to meet our global responsibility, my Administration is working with our Congress to deliver more than $11 billion a year to international climate financing to help lower- income countries implement their climate goals and ensure a just energy transition. The key part of that will be the President’s Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience plan, which will help half a billion people, especially vulnerable countries, to adapt to the impacts of climate change and build resilience. That need is enormous. Let this therefore be the moment when we find within ourselves the will to turn back the tide of climate devastation and unlock a resilient, sustainable and clean energy economy to preserve our planet.
With regard to global health, we delivered more than 620 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to 116 countries around the world, with more available to help meet countries’ needs, all of it free of charge with no strings attached. We are also working closely with the Group of 20 and other countries. And the United States has helped take the lead in establishing the ground-breaking new financial intermediary fund for pandemic prevention, preparedness and response at the World Bank.
At the same time, we have continued to advance the ball on enduring global health challenges. Later today, I will host the seventh Replenishment Conference of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. With bipartisan support in our Congress, I have pledged to contribute up to $6 billion to that effort. I therefore look forward to welcoming a historic round of pledges at the Conference, resulting in one of the largest global health fundraisers ever held in all of history. We are also confronting the food crisis head-on. With as many as 193 million people around the world experiencing acute food insecurity — a jump of 40 million in one year — lam announcing today another $2.9 billion in United States support for life-saving humanitarian and food security assistance for this year alone.
Russia in the meantime is pumping out lies, trying to pin the blame for the food crisis on the sanctions imposed by many countries in the world in response to the aggression against Ukraine. Let me be perfectly clear: our sanctions explicitly allow Russia the ability to export food and fertilizer. There is no limitation. It is Russia’s war that is worsening food insecurity, and only Russia can end it. I am grateful for the work being done here at the United Nations, including the leadership of the Secretary-General, in establishing a mechanism to export grain from Black Sea ports in Ukraine that Russia had blocked for months. We need to make sure that it is extended.
We believe strongly in the need to feed the world. That is why the United States is the world’s largest supporter of the World Food Programme, with more than 40 per cent of its budget. We are leading support of UNICEF’s efforts to feed children around the world. In order to take on the larger challenge of food insecurity, the United States introduced the Roadmap for Global Food Security — Call to Action to eliminate global food insecurity, which more than 100 Member States have already supported.
In June, the Group of Seven announced more than $4.5 billion to strengthen food security around the world. Through the Feed the Future initiative of the United States Agency for International Development, the United States is scaling up innovative ways to get drought- and heat-resistant seeds into the hands of farmers who need them, while distributing fertilizer and improving fertilizer efficiency so that farmers can grow more while using less. We are also calling on all countries to refrain from banning food exports or hoarding grain while so many people are suffering. In every country in the world, no matter what else divides us, if parents cannot feed their children, nothing else matters.
As we look to the future, we are working with our partners to update and create the rules of the road for the new challenges we face in the twenty-first century. We launched the European Union-United States Trade and Technology Council with the European Union in order to ensure that key technologies are developed and governed in a way that benefits everyone. With our partner countries and through the United Nations, we are supporting and strengthening the norms of responsibility for responsible State behaviour in cyberspace and working to hold accountable those
who use cyberattacks to threaten international peace and security.
With partners in the Americas, Africa, Europe, the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific region, we are working to build a new economic ecosystem in which every nation gets a fair shot and economic growth is resilient, sustainable and shared. That is why the United States has championed a global minimum tax, and we will work to see it implemented so that major corporations pay their fair share everywhere.
That was also the idea behind the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity, which the United States launched this year with 13 other Indo-Pacific economies. We are working with our partners in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Pacific island States to support a vision for a critical Indo- Pacific region that is free, open, connected, prosperous, secure and resilient. Together with partners around the world, we are working to secure resilient supply chains that protect everyone from coercion or domination and ensure that no country can use energy as a weapon.
As Russia’s war roils the global economy, we are also calling on major global creditors, including the non-Paris Club countries, to transparently negotiate debt forgiveness for lower-income countries in order to forestall broader economic and political crises around the world. Instead of infrastructure projects that generate huge and large debt without delivering on the promised advantages, let us meet the enormous infrastructure needs around the world with transparent investments and high-standard projects that protect the rights of workers and the environment and that are keyed to the needs of the communities they serve and not to the contributor.
That is why the United States, together with fellow Group of Seven partners, launched the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. We intend to collectively mobilize $600 billion in investment through that partnership by 2027. Dozens of projects are already under way — industrial-scale vaccine manufacturing in Senegal, transformative solar projects in Angola and a first-of-its-kind small modular nuclear power plant in Romania. Those are investments that will deliver returns, not just for those countries but for everyone. The United States will work with every nation, including its competitors, to solve global problems like climate change. Climate diplomacy is not a favour to the United States or any other nation, and walking away from it hurts the entire world.
Let me be direct about the competition between the United States and China. As we manage shifting geopolitical trends, the United States will conduct itself as a reasonable leader. We do not seek conflict. We do not seek a cold war. We do not ask any nation to choose between the United States or any other partner. But the United States will be unabashed in promoting our vision of a free, open, secure and prosperous world and what we have to offer communities of nations — investments that are designed not to foster dependency but to alleviate burdens and help nations become self-sufficient, as well as partnerships that are not intended to create political obligations but are based on the conviction that our own success and the success of each one of us is increased when other nations succeed as well.
When individuals have the chance to live in dignity and develop their talents, everyone benefits. Critical to that is living up to the highest goals of this institution, increasing peace and security for everyone, everywhere. The United States will not waver in its unrelenting determination to counter and thwart the continuing terrorist threats to our world. And we will lead with our diplomacy to strive for the peaceful resolution of conflicts.
We seek to uphold peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. We remain committed to our One China Policy, which has helped prevent conflict for four decades. And we continue to oppose unilateral changes in the status quo by either side. We support an African Union-led peace process to end the fight in Ethiopia and restore security for all its people. In Venezuela, where years of political oppression have driven more than 6 million people from that country, we urge for a Venezuelan-led dialogue and a return to free and fair elections. We continue to stand with our neighbour in Haiti as it faces politically fuelled gang violence and an enormous humanitarian crisis. And we call on the world to do the same. We have more to do. We will continue to back the United Nations-mediated truce in Yemen, which has delivered precious months of peace to people who have suffered years of war.
We will also continue to advocate for a lasting negotiated peace between the Jewish and democratic State of Israel and the Palestinian people. The United States is committed to Israel’s security — period. And a
negotiated two-State solution remains, in our view, the best way to ensure Israel’s security and prosperity for the future and give the Palestinians the State which to which they are entitled, with both sides fully respecting the equal rights of their citizens and both peoples enjoying an equal measure of freedom and dignity.
Let me also urge every nation to recommit to strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime through diplomacy. No matter what else is happening in the world, the United States is ready to pursue critical arms control measures. A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. The five permanent members of the Security Council just reaffirmed that commitment in January.
But today we are seeing disturbing trends. Russia shunned the non-proliferation ideals embraced by every other nation at the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. And as I said earlier, today they are making irresponsible threats to use nuclear weapons. China is conducting an unprecedented and concerning nuclear build-up without any transparency. Despite our efforts to begin serious and sustained diplomacy, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea continues to blatantly violate United Nations sanctions. While the United States is prepared for a mutual return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action if Iran steps up to its obligations, the United States is clear: we will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.
I continue to believe that diplomacy is the best way to achieve that outcome. The non-proliferation regime is one of the greatest successes of this institution. We cannot let the world now slide backwards, and neither can we turn a blind eye to the erosion of human rights. Perhaps singular among this organ’s achievements stands the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the standard by which our forebears challenged us to measure ourselves. They made clear in 1948 that human rights are the basis for all that we seek to achieve.
Yet today in 2022, fundamental freedoms are at risk in every part of our world, from the violations in Xinjiang detailed in recent reports of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to the horrible abuses against pro-democracy activists and ethnic minorities by the military regime in Burma and the increased repression of women and girls by the Taliban in Afghanistan. And today we stand with the brave citizens and the brave women of Iran, who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights.
But here is what I know: the future will be won by those countries that unleash the full potential of their populations, in which women and girls can exercise equal rights, including basic reproductive rights, and can contribute fully to building stronger economies and more resilient societies; religious and ethnic minorities can live their lives without harassment and contribute to the fabric of their communities; the LGBTQ+ community and individuals can live and love freely without being targeted with violence; and citizens can question and criticize their leaders without fear of reprisal. The United States will always promote human rights and the values enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations in our own country and around the world.
Let me end with this: this institution, guided by the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is at its core an act of dauntless hope. Let me say that once again: it is an act of dauntless hope. I ask everyone to think about the vision of those first delegates who undertook a seemingly impossible task while the world was still smouldering, and to think about how divided the people of the world must have felt, with their fresh grief for the millions dead and the genocidal horrors of the Holocaust exposed. They had every right to believe only the worst of humankind. Instead, they reached for what was best in all of us, and they strove to build something better — enduring peace, comity among nations, equal rights for every member of the human family and cooperation for the advancement of all humankind.
The challenges we face today are great indeed, but our capacity is greater. Our commitment must be greater still. Let us therefore stand together to once again declare the unmistakable resolve that nations of the world are united still, that we stand for the values of the Charter and that we still believe that by working together we can bend the arc of history towards a freer and more just world for all our children, although none of us have fully achieved it. We are not passive witnesses to history. We are the authors of history. We can do this — we have to do it — for ourselves, for our future and for humankind."
Uruguay,URY,South America,"  3,449,000 ",19896,7.889999866,6.4,77.77,Cardiovascular Disease,Neoplasm,Dementia,735,21.31,"  3,449,000 ",100.00,8.55,"Exactly two years ago, during the commemoration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, we were in the first year of the pandemic. It was a year replete with uncertainty and fear, owing to the unexpected outbreak of a virus, the historic aftermath of which, even today, continues to affect us in terms of loss of life, serious health ramifications for our populations and damage to our economies. Since then, the international situation has not only failed to improve, but new sources of tension have emerged that have made it difficult to make progress in economic recovery and in addressing the significant social costs of the pandemic.
The military invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation is unjustifiable. Our country has condemned it in the strongest terms as a clear violation of the principles on which we have built the Organization and that must be respected by all its members. It is imperative that the Russian Federation cease hostilities and withdraw from Ukraine as soon as possible. The parties to the conflict must work towards returning to the negotiating table to resolve their differences peacefully, as set out under the Charter of the United Nations.
In the meantime, the negative effects of the armed conflict are being felt in many spheres at the international level and are increasingly weighing on the daily lives of millions of people. The impact on international trade is fuelling recessionary trends in many countries. The shortage of agricultural products is seriously affecting least-developed importer countries, and the lack of access to world markets is leading to food insecurity in several regions of the world. Other countries are experiencing energy shortages or higher energy prices, which is having an impact on the living conditions of millions of people. At the same time, it has also created a new environmental threat.
Although its outcome did not meet everyone’s expectations, the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP26), held in Glasgow, in November 2021, saw the achievement of several promising results. Furthermore, it was clear that countries have not given up on the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The discussions at COP26, in Glasgow, will allow for further debate in other contexts in the near future. We hope that the high level of ambition will be maintained by all countries and that the promise to muster the financial resources necessary to support adaptation and mitigation measures against climate change will be kept. Otherwise, the international community will have missed another opportunity — perhaps its last — to address one of the greatest threats facing it. If we fail in that work, future generations will be justified in saying that we, who governed during this century, did not live up to shouldering our political responsibilities.
In that regard, I would like to renew Uruguay’s support for the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and our firm commitment to achieving its objectives and its concrete targets. That is the shared goal that we have set for ourselves, and we must make a greater effort to achieve it. In that context, as we face such significant challenges, “multilateralism” is not a hollow or meaningless word. It is therefore essential to strengthen the multilateral system, to which we all belong and which constitutes a common asset. International and regional mechanisms must be strengthened and improved to make them more effective and preventive.
The international community is today facing three major challenges: international peace and security; the environment; and global health. The multilateral system is essential to addressing those challenges, not only as an inspirational principle, but also as a key tool for making our work effective. In that regard, I would like to reaffirm once again our commitment to multilateralism.
Despite the interconnected shocks of2022, this year should also be seen as a milestone for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We are already living in the decade of action, and it remains imperative that we translate words into the realization of the Goals. To that end, Uruguay submitted its fifth voluntary national review on the achievements and targets met by our country in 2021. The reviews clearly reaffirm my country’s commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to achieving the SDGs.
Uruguay is sparing no effort to create proactive public policies and improve the relevant indicators. Within the international system, there are persistent shortcomings that affect and weaken the work that has been done in pursuit of our countries’ economic and social development. Many times, the need to establish certain criteria in order to ensure international cooperation results in adverse, undesired and extremely negative outcomes. Many countries, including Uruguay, have been adversely affected by the archaic concept of development based on per capita income and resulting in a graduation process that, in practice, constitutes a punishment for countries on the path to development that have achieved a better redistribution of income.
States shoulder the primary responsibility to protect the human rights of their populations. We are deeply shocked to see that, in many parts of the world, the basic rights of millions of men, women and children are being flagrantly violated, which is made even worse when the perpetrators of such atrocities are their people’s own rulers, who misuse repressive mechanisms and violate their international obligations in this domain. That reality is all the more difficult to bear and disturbing, as we have such examples in our own region of Latin America and the Caribbean. There is no more appropriate forum than the General Assembly in which to reaffirm Uruguay’s humanist and humanitarian vocation and reiterate its continued and permanent commitment to the human rights agenda, while demanding that the international commitments undertaken by the members of the Organization be fully respected by all actors of the international community.
Similarly, we must ensure that efforts to address such sensitive issues in the relevant multilateral forums are carried out in an objective and non-politicized manner. In that regard, I would like to underscore Uruguay’s firm commitment to strengthening mechanisms dedicated to the protection of the rights of women, children, adolescents, the elderly, migrants, persons with disabilities and the members of the LGBTI community.
Migratory waves resulting from wars, internal conflicts and political and economic crises of various magnitudes have increased in recent years. Hotspots of regional instability, such as those resulting from the conflict in Ukraine, the civil war in Syria and events in Libya, Myanmar and Venezuela — in our own region — have caused an increase in the flow of people and families fleeing their homes and countries in search of security and relief. I would like to highlight the role of the International Criminal Court as a central mechanism of the international justice system and its relevance as a deterrent and means of punishment for the perpetrators of acts of genocide, mass atrocities and crimes against humanity.
With regard to the maintenance of international peace and security, and as it does every year, Uruguay renews its support for United Nations peacekeeping missions and operations. Our country has a long history of contributing to those missions, which began in the late 1940s, and has continuously deployed troops in various missions for more than 70 years. Uruguay was among the first 15 troop contributors to the United Nations system, and our main troop deployments are currently in the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force in the Golan Heights. Uruguay is unwavering in its commitment to peace, international security and the protection of civilians. In line with the spirit and provisions of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), Uruguay officially submitted its national action plan on women and peace and security on 21 July.
Uruguay is one of the founding countries of the Organization and throughout its history has worked collaboratively to meet its goal of maintaining international peace and security. Uruguay does not believe that peace is possible in the world without the firm and serious commitment of the international community in the area of disarmament and non-proliferation.
The impasse and paralysis recently experienced in in the framework of the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons must make us reflect upon this particular moment in the history of the United Nations. Uruguay has supported and will continue to support the United Nations disarmament agenda. It will therefore continue to tirelessly seek agreements to enable the disarmament architecture to function effectively and reliably.
Among the current factors responsible for insecurity at the international level, we must recall the growing influence of international organized crime, drug trafficking and international terrorism. As my country’s Government has made combating crime and drug trafficking one of its priorities in order to provide its citizens with a greater level of security, I reiterate Uruguay’s firm commitment to and cooperation in the fight against organized crime and terrorist activities at the regional and international levels.
Uruguay is committed to the cybersecurity agenda and combating cybercrime. The Organization shoulders a major responsibility in that area, and Uruguay actively participates in the relevant activities under way. In addition, Uruguay has formalized its request to the Council of Europe to accede to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, also known as the Budapest Convention, and thereby is ready to embrace the most modern legislation available to deal with cybercrime.
As we all know, the various activities of the Organization are numerous, timely and necessary, but as Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has rightly said, we must combat the dysfunctionality that paralyses us. As leaders, we have an obligation to ensure that the Organization represents all citizens, including the voiceless and faceless, and is not perceived as an annual display of rhetoric for representatives and diplomats.
Democracy is not a perfect model and does not resolve all the world’s problems, but it is clearly the system of Government that best safeguards people’s greatest aspiration — their freedom. Democracy is the form of Government that uniquely represents and reflects the human condition itself, our expectations of spiritual and material betterment and the enjoyment of the right to choose. Democracy and the rule of law are necessarily interdependent elements and essential for ensuring that the social and political order of a country represents the genuine will of its citizens.
However, democracy and its principles and values are systematically under attack in many parts of the world. For Uruguay, the democratic system is part of its history and its best traditions. It is an identifying feature of our society. We are proud to be considered as a full-fledged democracy, but we are also aware of our responsibility as leaders to strengthen it every day and protect it from the many challenges it faces.
That democratic edifice, together with its values and guiding principles — our democracy and our rule of law — have enabled Uruguay’s voice to be not only heard but also respected in the international community. Those were, are and will remain the fundamental pillars on which my country’s contribution to the international order rests. On that basis, Uruguay renews its commitment to the international system of nations."

I also take this opportunity to thank His Excellency Mr. Abdulla Shahid for his successful leadership of the seventy-sixth session of the Assembly.
The world today faces a deep crisis of trust at the global level and an intensification of numerous challenges to stability and security, a growth of geopolitical confrontation and an increased risk of bloc mentality.
The expansion and aggravation of armed conflicts in various parts of the world are destabilizing international trade and economic ties, which have not yet recovered from the consequences of the pandemic. The challenges of ensuring food and energy security are increasing. The global climate shocks, the growing shortage of natural and water resources, and the spread of infectious diseases all contribute to the aggravation of conflicts and the emergence of humanitarian crises, and they also threaten the foundation of life.
Clearly, no country can avoid global risk and challenges or tackle them alone. Constructive dialogue and multilateral cooperation, based on consideration and respect for the interests of all countries, are the only way out of the dangerous spiral of crisis. Effective international cooperation is essential if the world is to become more stable, predictable and prosperous.
Under the current conditions, we strongly believe it is important to strengthen the central role of the United Nations in addressing global and regional challenges. The United Nations should evolve in order for it to respond effectively to the transformation taking place.
The establishment of intercivilizational and intercultural relations and dialogue is also extremely important for finding coherent approaches and solutions and relieving global tensions, uncertainty and unpredictability.
With that in mind, at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit that was held in Samarkand on 16 September, the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, put forward the Samarkand Solidarity Initiative for Common Security and Prosperity. Its goal is to contribute to the restoration of mutual trust and stability in international relations, as well as to strengthen solidarity through the establishment of broad dialogue free from geopolitical rivalry, ideological contradictions and disputes. We propose to jointly exchange views on the practical implementation of that initiative at the Samarkand forum to be held in 2023, with the participation of United Nations representatives, political leaders, the public business community and academia.
This year, we adopted the Development Strategy for New Uzbekistan for 2022-2026, which aims to deepen the democratic process, ensure the rule of law and improve living standards. The strategy is based on the outcomes of the reforms carried out in our country over the previous five years and is designed to advance the comprehensive implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. In particular, by 2030 we intend to halve the level of poverty, increase the effectiveness of the social protection system to respond to all those in need, strengthen food security and become one of the world’s upper-middle-income countries.
Currently, Uzbekistan is on the eve of an important political event: a constitutional reform. The key goal of updating the Constitution is to ensure sustainability and responsibility in the process of the fundamental transformation of the State system and public administration in a way that will respect and protect the honour and dignity of the people and guarantee their inviolable rights and freedoms. The idea of human honour and dignity will be deeply enshrined in the Constitution.
Norms on the complete abolition of the death penalty, the Miranda rule and habeas corpus, as well as environmental human rights, will be introduced in the Constitution. The constitutional amendments will become directly applicable and aim to guarantee and protect the interests of people of all backgrounds. In particular, the prohibition of forced labour and the other worst forms of child labour and the protection of the employment rights of pregnant women and women with children will be guaranteed at the constitutional level. Furthermore, the introduction of norms that ensure the openness, transparency and accountability of State agencies has also been proposed.
The amendments to the Constitution were reviewed by the public and will be put to a referendum.
We fully endorse the initiative of Secretary- General Antonio Guterres to hold the Summit of the Future in September 2023. Uzbekistan greatly appreciates the successful outcome of the historic Transforming Education Summit, which demonstrated the commitment of the international community to advance efforts to achieve the rapid restoration and modernization of the education system by increasing funding and innovation.
Uzbekistan has already achieved tangible results in that area. Over the past five years, enrolment in higher education increased from 9 to 29 per cent, and the rate of enrolment of children in preschool education increased from 27 to 67 per cent.
Young people should play a key role in the processes that are directly related to their fate and future. To that end, Uzbekistan plans to convene the first meeting of the Youth Council of the countries of Central Asia and South Asia in 2023, which will become a platform for new ideas and specific initiatives. We count on the support of the United Nations in convening that important forum.
From 14 to 16 November in Tashkent, we will host jointly with UNESCO the World Conference on Early Childhood Care and Education. That forum will facilitate the exchange of best practices to ensure universal, equitable and quality education. We invite the Ministers of Education of Member States to participate in that high-level forum.
Thanks to the joint efforts of the Central Asian States, a fundamentally new political atmosphere has been created in our region. Launched at the initiative of Uzbekistan, the mechanism of consultative meetings of the Heads of State of the region has become a vivid symbol of a new era of regional cooperation. At the most recent consultative meeting, held on 21 July, the truly historic Treaty of Friendship, Good Neighbourliness and Cooperation for the Development of Central Asia in the Twenty-First century was agreed. The international recognition of the deepening partnership of the countries of the region is reflected in a number of resolutions adopted by the General Assembly in support of strengthening peace, stability and regional cooperation in Central Asia.
We rely on the further support of the international community in the process of rapprochement and cooperation among the countries of Central Asia and the integration of the region into the global economy and transport networks.
We express our gratitude to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for supporting our initiative to hold an international conference on the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy in Central Asia, which was held in March in Tashkent. Taking into account the outcomes of that forum, we propose the establishment of a United Nations counter-terrorism regional office in Central Asia in order to successfully implement the Global Strategy and continuously monitor the implementation of the updated Joint Plan of Action of Central Asian States.
The prospects for the development of Central Asia are inextricably linked to ensuring peace in neighbouring Afghanistan. We are concerned about the decline in the international attention being placed on that country, which is experiencing a deep humanitarian crisis. We consider it extremely important to prevent the isolation of Afghanistan, which is being left to address its existing problems on its own. That will undoubtedly have negative consequences for regional and international security.
The International Conference on Afghanistan, which was held in July in Tashkent with the participation of the delegation of the interim Government, showed the interest of the world community in the development of coordinated approaches towards that country.
We are convinced that the overall priority of the international community should be to restore the Afghan economy and ensure its integration into regional economic processes and the implementation of infrastructure and socially significant projects. To solve that problem, the support of the United Nations, international financial institutions and donor countries is needed.
Uzbekistan is making a feasible contribution to international efforts to assist Afghanistan. Uzbekistan has established an international transport and logistics hub in the border city of Termez, which is actively used by United Nations agencies to provide humanitarian assistance to the country. We propose that a special humanitarian support fund for Afghanistan be created in Termez and that financial resources be allocated to it in order to overcome the social crisis and implement educational programmes for young people and healthcare projects.
Resolution 76/295, on strengthening connectivity between Central and South Asia, which was adopted in July 2022 at the initiative of Uzbekistan, prioritizes the involvement of Afghanistan in economic cooperation and its transformation into a bridge connecting the two regions. The practical implementation of those ideas will be facilitated by the implementation of transregional infrastructure projects, such as the construction of the Termez-Mazar-i-Sharif-Kabul-Peshawar railway. The solution to the problem of involving Afghanistan in regional trade and economic relations will be facilitated by the proposed establishment by Uzbekistan, with the support of the United Nations, of an interregional centre for connectivity in Tashkent.
Today the negative consequences of climate change are acutely apparent in our region. We stand ready to actively participate in multilateral efforts to promote the topical issues of the green agenda and the processes that curb climate change.
Uzbekistan has assumed the additional obligation of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and is implementing a comprehensive strategy for the transition to a green economy and the development of renewable energy. In 2021, the President of Uzbekistan launched a broad initiative called “Yashil Makon” or “Green Nation” through which 1 billion trees and shrubs are to be planted across the country over the next five years.
The Aral Sea is the largest environmental crisis in our region. Over the past five years, 1.7 million hectares of forest plantings have been introduced on
the drained seabed. I take this opportunity to thank the General Assembly for adopting the resolution declaring the Aral Sea region a zone of ecological innovation and technologies (resolution 75/278). This year, under the auspices of the United Nations, we plan to host in Nukus the first Aral Sea international forum. In 2023, we will host the fourteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, as well as a meeting in Uzbekistan of the Committee to Review the Implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. We invite the Member States and United Nations agencies to take part in these events at the highest level.
This year we celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of Uzbekistan’s membership in the United Nations, which is the only universal structure for maintaining international peace and security. We reaffirm Uzbekistan’s commitment to the United Nations Charter and express readiness to deepen multifaceted cooperation with the Organization."

“The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela extends a greeting of brotherhood to the Presidents, Heads of Government and Prime Ministers of the 193 countries of the United Nations.
“Likewise, we salute Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Mr. Csaba Korosi, President of the General Assembly, and other authorities present at this seventy-seventh annual general debate, wishing them every success in the development of this important debate of ideas for timely and collective action in the face of common problems.
“I take the time allotted to us to speak in this forum, on behalf of 30 million Venezuelan men and women, to send an open letter to humankind, which I believe is the sole addressee and purpose that gives meaning to the words of a twenty-first century leader, above all at such a crucial moment for the world, when greater stewardship is needed from the peoples in creating alternatives to transform reality. It is also because we have never been so aware of being a single community, one and multiple at the same time, as we are now as the very thing we share and that makes us equal — life itself — hangs in the balance. This letter comes from the heart of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, a country that many have heard of and of which, paradoxically, little is known in relation to its political truth, its historical identity and its concrete reality.
“Certainly, a pernicious global campaign of discredit and stigmatization has been waged against our people, our republican institutions and our democratic revolution, for the simple fact that, in the waning days of the last century, we challenged the single-minded regime that was imposed on the world under the mask of the market economy and neoliberal globalization — a model that, in the name of freedom, became the modern version of colonization.
“The aim of this campaign against Venezuela is none other than to create the objective conditions to politically and economically suffocate any attempt to create alternatives to the imperialist and predatory system that capitalism, in all its historical phases, has turned out to be. Imposing their false story, they accuse us of being a dictatorship and a failed State to hide the truth from the world. During the past two decades, my country has held 29 free elections that have defined the social, economic and political model that we call Bolivarian socialism. That is why we have been attacked in multiple ways.
“The peoples of the world should know that every kind of playbook has been applied to Venezuela to destabilize its democracy.
“Politically, imperialism has been unsuccessfully using the illegal method of regime change. They have promoted assassination attempts and invasions, created seditious movements against the Constitution, and even invented a fictitious parallel Government that bordered on the ridiculous.
“Economically, few know that 913 illegal sanctions weigh on our small but dignified country, which, in a word, prevent my people from selling and buying what they produce and need for the development and enjoyment of our individual and collective existence. This translates concretely into suffering, deprivation and systematic attacks that restrict life and the collective rights of my country, which is why we do not hesitate to denounce such cruel measures as crimes against humanity. This economic war, whose losses for my nation have exceeded $150 billion dollars in recent years, intensified during the most serious phase of the global pandemic, making it impossible for us to buy medical supplies, medicines and vaccines.
“The stigmatization has also served Europe and the United States as an alibi for carrying out the most shameless plundering that has been committed against our patrimony and assets abroad. More than 31 tons of Venezuelan gold reserves deposited in the Bank of England, calculated to be worth $1.3 billion, remain sequestered. Another example is the theft of the Citgo Petroleum Corporation, valued at more than $30 billion in February 2019, adding to the more than $10 billion of Venezuelan deposits and funds illegally blocked in foreign banks.
“But these illegal sanctions have never been able to bend the will of our people, but have strengthened it in the same way that the conscience and the resolve to be free are strengthened. Neither have they sidetracked us from our path to social justice. Even in the worst circumstances, our model protects and prioritizes human beings in their social rights: access to housing, education, health, work and culture.
“This act of piracy against our country, however, has left deep wounds in society. Those include induced migration, which is flaunted in the media for political and propaganda purposes precisely by those who have propagated and promoted it with false promises and a blockade of their living conditions. Nothing is said about the fact that 60 per cent of the Venezuelans who migrated have voluntarily returned to their country, fleeing conditions of slavery and exploitation, as well as the mistreatment and persecution to which they have been subjected in many countries of the world. Also hidden from the world is the fact that the Venezuelan State is the only one that has a repatriation policy through its airline, Conviasa, which has been permanently boycotted due to illegal sanctions.
“We ask the multilateral organizations: where have the millions in resources supposedly earmarked to support Venezuelan migrants gone? Accountability would be useful in clearing up the opacity with which such allocations have been carried out. In the same way, we demand that multilateral organizations guarantee the rights of all migrants throughout the world. We do so with the moral authority of a country that, for more than 100 years, has been a beneficiary of good practices towards its migrant population. In this vein, we alert the peoples of the world to the resurgence of xenophobia and aporophobia, hate speech and crimes, and intolerance in general incubated by neo-fascist and neo-Nazi movements that find shelter in political parties and ultra-conservative and far-right Governments.
“Humankind, which sees and listens to us today, has the right to know that, even in the most extreme conditions that I have summarized here, our people have not given up. Quite the contrary, they have paved the way for the consolidation of social peace, economic recovery and the strengthening of democracy. We know in our own flesh the adversity and the miracles that our own will and effort can work. For this reason and from concrete experience, we have built consensus around social and political peace. We have launched an economic plan to confront the blockade, creating new sources of wealth such as tourism, national industrialization, entrepreneurship and agricultural development.
“For the first time in 120 years, we are producing 80 per cent of what we consume and can therefore affirm that we are in a position to join efforts to face the great threats that loom over the world. As one of the main world Powers in oil and gas matters, Venezuela can and wants to be useful, as a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, in the energy emergency that has been dragging on for a decade and profoundly affecting the price and supply system, impacting the poorest and richest countries alike.
“The coronavirus disease pandemic and the conflict between Ukraine and Russia have dramatically aggravated the situation. However, beyond our historical ability to guarantee, as an irreplaceable producer, the energy balance demanded by the international community, we are concerned about the impact of the various world conflicts on food security. Venezuela has 30 million cultivable hectares and is convinced that only a return to sustainable agriculture can help overcome world hunger and poverty. We offer our potential and our firm determination to work actively in the search for global solutions.
“Undoubtedly, all nations are beset by various problems, each of such profound complexity and gravity that it would be difficult to rank them. Perhaps, of all of them, one of the most imperative is that of world peace and security, which today is severely weakened, as has been mentioned by all those who have preceded me at this rostrum. Regardless of our ideological positions, we must agree on the need to prioritize the re-establishment of the diplomatic path and political dialogue over military confrontation. Humankind will not survive a world war. Therefore, an escalation of war in any part of the world is in no one’s interest.
“For my country, a people that has never participated in an international armed conflict, there is no other way than peace, justice, trust and respect for international law. We therefore endorse the proposal of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who calls for the creation of an international commission to facilitate sovereign dialogue between Russia and Ukraine, and we stand ready to facilitate its conditions. We reject all the military provocations and interfering economic sanctions that have been taken against Russia, as well as the hate campaign unleashed against the Slavic people, believing that such actions, far from adding to peace, fuel the fire of war. In my country’s opinion — and I am sure that public opinion is on our side — there is no such thing as good wars and bad wars.
“After the United States invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, international trust was broken and the contradictions typical of an imperialist and supremacist logic became more acute. Since then, we have seen blood spilled with impunity in Iraq, Yemen, Haiti, Somalia, Libya and Syria, to name just a few milestones in the shameful tragedy that is destroying indispensable international law.
“Notwithstanding what has been said, in Venezuela we have reasons to be optimistic. That is because we have learned to trust the people — its intelligence, its benevolence and its attachment to justice and true life. But it is necessary to recognize that the dominant world order faces multiple crises competing in their lethal potential, converging and articulating with one another. The climate crisis aggravates the food crisis, the health crisis deepens the social crisis, the energy crisis intensifies the economic crisis, and the latter endangers world peace.
“Transversally to all this, the no less pernicious crisis of truth is upon us, now exacerbated by information contamination and fake news. We are facing a regime of representation, misrepresentation and suppression of reality imposed by the algorithm of new communication technologies at the convenience of the most powerful. The manipulation of information and emotions is only part of the problem.
“We are witnessing a global state of surveillance and digital control that violates citizens’ rights to privacy and truthful information, turning our democracies into infocracies, as the South Korean philosopher Byung Chul-Han states in his most recent book. The death of truth is the clearest symptom of the decline of a civilization and the preamble to perpetual conflict. Let us not allow the truth to succumb at the historical moment when we have the best chance of applying it, together with reason and sensitivity, as an antidote to collapse.
“The peoples of America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Oceania know that, due to its transcendent and definitive nature, we must face this multidimensional crisis with humanity by going to the heart of the problem. Where is the telluric fault that is shaking the building of the prevailing order? It lies in the crisis of the Western supremacist, imperialist model of civilization, which denies, attacks and tries to suppress the other and the differences among us, and that does not recognize other models or other political, economic, religious or cultural paradigms foreign to its own.
“Despite Western arrogance, we are experiencing a post-imperial change of era, and the global North must recognize that the reigning unipolar and colonialist order is not capable of responding satisfactorily to the problems and needs that it has created to the detriment of humankind, animal life and the planet. The latter is, from our ordinary worldview, the living being most exploited, violated and destroyed by capitalism in all its historical phases.
“We are not just engaging in ideological reflection, nothing more. The climate crisis, which is already irreversible, could be the confirmation that a change of model is imminent.
“The North must accept the indisputable emergence of new Powers and new leadership, such as China, Russia, India, Iran and Tiirkiye. It has to be open to the possibility of being part of a multipolar, pluricentric world that is free of hegemony. It is urgent that there be an ethical change among the old Powers to build a common new world without colonizers or colonized, in which we work together towards the solutions that our peoples demand of us. There is no time for arrogance or useless confrontations or skirmishes.
“In very unique circumstances 207 years ago, the freedom fighter Simon Bolivar, in his prophetic Jamaica Letter, invoked the wisdom of the West.
“‘And shall Europe, the civilized, the merchant, the lover of liberty allow an aged serpent, bent only on satisfying its venomous rage, devour the fairest part of our globe? ... Is Europe deaf to the clamour of her own interests?’ (Selected Writings of Bolivar, Volume 1 ,p. 107)
“In that regard, I wonder whether European and North American leadership is deaf. We ask ourselves that today, as we are on the brink of a crisis that could be the last crisis for humankind.
“Venezuela hopes that the Assembly will listen to reason, wisdom and prudence, recognize and respect the rights of the peoples of the world and address the injustice committed against the Saharawi and the Palestinian people by denying them the right to a homeland. We hope for an end to the illegal economic sanctions and political persecution against Nicaragua and against our brotherly Cuba, Iran and Russia. We hope that the Argentine people will be compensated and that their rights over the Malvinas Islands, taken with blood and fire by the imperial logic that we have denounced, will be restored.
“Only through dialogue, only through words and reason shared among equals, can we build the bridges we need to heal the wounds and leave behind the abyss that instils fear in humankind.
“It is with that belief, and not to comply with the protocol of the general debate, that I send this message. My focus is on the streets, where the ordinary men and women of Abyei, New York, Istanbul, London, Damascus, Ramallah, Tehran, Cape Town, Moscow, Beijing, Managua, Havana, Caracas and many more places are not looking for answers but rather for a call to be part of the building of a new humanity. Because I believe in the power of words and in those men and women who refuse to give up hope, I am sure that this call will not fall on deaf ears.
“Let us have the good sense to recognize that the hegemonic global model is coming to an end, and let us arm ourselves with the necessary enthusiasm to build a new multicentric, multipolar, intercultural and balanced world.
“Let us change what needs to be changed and let us have the courage to be reborn in the face of new times and new challenges. Another world, another life, is not only possible — it is today more urgent than ever.”
That statement was written by Nicolas Maduro Moros in Caracas on 24 September."

As Vice-President, Viet Nam has full confidence in his able leadership and guidance and will work with him to steer the work of the Assembly to success.
I thank Mr. Abdulla Shahid, President of the General Assembly at its seventy-sixth session, for his important contributions to the work of the General Assembly, and Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for the leadership and innovation he has instilled in the Organization over the past year.
We are at a watershed moment in history. Confrontation, conflicts and violations of international law continue to intensify, mirroring great Power competition and unilateralism. Global military expenditure surged to a record high $2.1 trillion, while the international community failed to mobilize $100 billion for climate actions.
The nuclear risk has reached its highest point in decades, but that was still not enough for the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to achieve any collective commitment to action.
The outbreak of armed conflicts and heightened tension, especially between major Powers, have made the international security climate more volatile than at any time since the Cold War.
The climate crisis and other non-traditional security risks threaten our very existence.
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has wreaked havoc on health systems, economies and societies worldwide. Poverty, inequalities, violence and exclusion are denying the rights of millions to the basic necessities of life. With less than a decade to go, the Sustainable Development Goals are even further off track.
Facing these multiple crises, developing countries and vulnerable groups, which lack the capacity, resources and resilience to cope with external shocks, are those hardest hit. To reverse this course, we must fundamentally change our ways of thinking and doing things. This entails reshaping a global approach to addressing global issues, enhancing resilience and placing people at the core of all development efforts.
And key to such an approach is international solidarity and partnerships at all levels. We know this from our own history. International solidarity has been crucial to the success of Viet Nam’s national liberation and reunification. Multilateralization and diversification of partnerships, meanwhile, have proven indispensable to Viet Nam’s foreign policy of independence, self-reliance, peace, cooperation and development. They have opened the door for Viet Nam to the world and helped bring catalytic resources to propel Viet Nam’s Doi Moi renovation process. They have helped improved the lives tens of millions of Vietnamese and brought prosperity to a formerly war- torn country, now confidently on a path to become a developed, high-income country by 2045.
But I believe the experience of Viet Nam is not an exception. There is an abundance of stories about how solidarity and partnerships triumph over mistrust and fragmentation and bring about positive change. As we move forward in the spirit of solidarity and partnership, I wish to underline four key points:
First, a confrontational and zero-sum game approach must be eliminated. Imposition, intervention and unilateral acts have no place in the good conduct of international affairs. Major Powers are particularly looked upon to behave responsibly and work for the common good and not their own selfish interests. Viet Nam calls for strengthened multilateralism and international cooperation in the spirit of openness, inclusiveness, equality and mutual benefit. Major United Nations and international agendas, especially the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and climate actions, must not be put on hold due to isolated disagreements among countries. We must stay focused on our common goals and responsibilities.
We stand in firm solidarity with the people of Cuba and call for the immediate lifting of the unilateral embargoes on Cuba, which are contrary to international law.
Secondly, our actions, both individually and collectively, must be guided by and in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations. Viet Nam firmly believes that respect for international law, especially respect for the sovereign
equality, political independence and territorial integrity of States and the peaceful settlement of disputes, is the most effective and viable measure to prevent conflicts and promote sustainable peace and security. Constructive dialogue and respect for the legitimate rights and interests of all parties, in accordance with international law, are key to resolving differences and reducing tensions.
Viet Nam calls for the cessation of hostilities in Ukraine, and stands ready to contribute to the diplomatic process and to the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Ukraine.
Thirdly, we need strong and effective multilateral institutions, with the United Nations at their heart, to best address global challenges. They are best positioned to initiate and incubate transformative ideas approaches and solutions and to forge partnerships and mobilize resources for the implementation of those initiatives. Viet Nam welcomes the forward-looking proposals in the Secretary-General’s Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) report. We will engage actively in the deliberation of these proposals, and in the preparations of the Summit of the Future and the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. We have high hopes that these summits will provide concrete, meaningful and long-lasting commitment and actions.
Fourthly, regional organizations can pioneer and play a prominent role in bolstering multilateral cooperation.
In South East Asia, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is doing its part to help address regional and global issues. We are working to build a strong and united ASEAN community and advance the central role of ASEAN in the regional security architecture. Building a broad and extensive network of partnerships, ASEAN has created a premier forum for strategic dialogue, engaging important partners of the region, especially with major Powers. ASEAN is working hard to implement the five-point consensus to help find comprehensive solutions to the situation in Myanmar.
Viet Nam underlines the need to maintain peace, stability, maritime safety and security in the South China Sea, and calls on all parties to resolve disputes by peaceful means, in full respect for legal and diplomatic processes. We call on parties to exercise self-restraint, refrain from unilateral activities and attempts to change the status quo, and not to threaten or use force, in accordance with international law, including the United Nations Charter and the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
This year, Viet Nam celebrates its forty-fifth year as a Member of the United Nations. Since that September day in 1977, the United Nations has been a trusted friend and reliable partner, standing with us in our most difficult times of post-war reconstruction and more recently in the fight against COVID-19, and accompanying us on our path of Doi Moi renovation, improving our people’s lives and advancing the country’s development.
Welcoming Viet Nam to the United Nations 45 years ago, the President of the General Assembly at its thirty-second session highlighted Viet Nam’s dedication to the purposes and principles and affirmed that the admission of Viet Nam “marks a further step towards consolidating peace and security in the world” (A/32/PV.1, para.95).
Forty-five years on, these statements remain valid. Viet Nam’s history and its vision for the future have always been intimately linked to its aspirations for peace and development. We have consistently supported and pursued a balanced and constructive approach in seeking lasting solutions to global issues.
As member of major United Nations bodies, most recently the Security Council, Viet Nam has consistently underlined the importance of upholding the United Nations Charter and ensuring that the United Nations best serves the needs and interests of all Members. Our men and women are proudly serving in the United Nations peacekeeping missions in South Sudan, Abyei and the Central African Republic.
Viet Nam is sparing no effort to realize our commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, an ambitious goal given the level of development and technology capacity of Viet Nam.
At the Human Rights Council, Viet Nam has consistently worked to advance mutual understanding and respect and to foster dialogue and cooperation. We lead efforts to promote the rights of vulnerable groups in the context of climate change.
And now we are aspiring to a seat at the Human Rights Council for the term 2023-2025. I hope we can count on the members’ valuable support, just as they can count on us as a reliable, responsible and constructive partner in the promotion and protection of all human rights for all.
In unity there is strength; with solidarity and partnership, there is power. Let us all work together in unity, solidarity and a spirit of partnership to surmount the interlocking challenges we all are facing together at this watershed moment, for the sake of sustainable peace and development in the world."

I wish him every success in managing the work of this session, the theme of which is “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”.
I also sincerely congratulate his predecessor, Mr. Abdulla Shahid, representative of Maldives, for his efforts to uphold the purposes and principles of the Organization.
I further commend and pay tribute to the role played by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in strengthening the presence of the United Nations amid all those global and intertwined challenges.
I would like to thank all United Nations staff, agencies and envoys for their tireless efforts to alleviate the suffering of our Yemeni people. Through their good offices and continued efforts, they have striven to bring peace and stability to my country, which has been drained by eight years of war and major humanitarian crisis caused by the Houthi terrorist militias, supported by the Iranian regime. I take this opportunity to sincerely congratulate our great Yemeni people who, concurrent with this meeting, are celebrating their national days on 26 September, 14 October and 30 November. Those dates represent key milestones of cultural and social development in my country, including the proclamation of the Republican regime in 1962, which is being undermined by the new Imams six decades after the proclamation, which was based on the principles of freedom and justice and the eradication of disparities and racial discrimination, in addition to women’s participation and the guarantee of rights and liberties.
It is an honour for me to speak to the Assembly today for the first time as President of the Presidential Leadership Council of the Republic of Yemen. For the eighth year in a row, a Yemeni leader is addressing
the Assembly about the war, destruction and the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. Every year, our leaders come to this edifice to reveal the further suffering and pain of the Yemeni people and to recall the memory of the courageous leaders, women, children, neighbours, friends and work colleagues whom we are losing day after day because of the war, epidemics, illness or hunger. Every year passes without the adoption of a robust position on the Yemeni dossier, while our losses pile up and the militias and terrorist groups become increasingly dangerous in their transnational threats and perpetrate stark violations of human rights that have been the subject of consensus within the Organization for more than 70 years now.
I am here today to share with the Assembly once again the story of the great and patient Yemeni people, their struggle and suffering, as well as their questions addressed to all of us. They are asking if we can undertake serious work this time to bring an end to the bloodshed, save lives, defeat extremism and terrorism and protect the will of our people and their legitimate aspirations to recover their State, participate in political life, live a good life and rid themselves of sectarian and religious extremism and hate speech.
The international community has consistently held a unified position on the Yemeni issue, and we are proud of and appreciative for that. In the beginning, there was the plan to transfer power based on the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiatives and its implementation mechanism in 2011. Then came the inclusive National Dialogue Conference, which ended in January 2014 and involved all components of the Yemeni society, including the Houthis. That led to a reference document guaranteeing the Yemeni people’s broad participation; meeting their aspirations for democracy, justice, equality in citizenship and women’s broad participation; and preserving the right of vulnerable categories of society and freedom of belief. It culminated with the Security Council meeting that took place in Sana’a in 2013.
That dream did not last long after the Houthi terrorist militias turned against the national consensus that arose from the inclusive dialogue. The militias prevented the holding of the popular referendum on the new constitution. They invaded the capital, Sana’a, and other Yemeni cities while hunting down the President of the country and pushing the Government of national consensus to Aden. They tried to assassinate the President and took control of the State institutions. They declared a war on neighbouring countries and the entire world. That is how the destructive war started, which today poses a real threat to the security of the region, in particular international navigation routes and global energy supplies.
In the years since, the war has killed and wounded hundreds of thousands of people and caused 20 million to suffer from famine. Hundreds of thousands of refugees have had to seek refuge in various countries and continents. There are more than 4 million internally displaced persons living in camps in extreme conditions. The war destroyed the people’s means of subsistence along with our nascent democracy. It also brought epidemics and floods related to climate change, causing death, destruction and the collapse of our protection network and governmental care. That left us with limited capabilities to save lives, given the intransigence of the terrorist militias and their rejection of all efforts to achieve sustainable peace, rebuild our country and realize development.
On 7 April, a new era based on partnership and national consensus began in our country with the establishment of the Presidential Leadership Council as the legitimate representative of the Yemeni people and their political will. It was welcomed by our people, the region and the international community. Since it was established, the Presidential Leadership Council has strived to achieve peace, end the human suffering and the lofty goals of restoring the State, ending the coup and reactivating the system of rights and freedoms, along with citizenship equality, enabling women and youth to decide their future, and achieve the desired peace. Over the past six months, the Presidential Leadership Council has worked closely with the Government of political competencies and with our brothers in the alliance that supports the legitimate Government, led by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and various regional and international partners. Urgently needed reform programmes are being set up to activate our institutions, improve services, curb the collapse of our national currency, and tackle severe inflation and the global food crisis.
We have prioritized the rebuilding of our security and military institutions, as well as the judicial branch, which had ceased its functions for about two years. We are working to fight corruption and combat terrorism and organized crime. We are activating law enforcement institutions, realizing justice and protecting public freedoms and social peace.
The Presidential Leadership Council stresses its adherence to the peace approach pursuant to the terms of the comprehensive solution of the Yemeni crisis reference, namely, the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative and its implementation mechanism, as well as with the relevant resolutions of international legitimacy, in particular Security Council resolution 2216 (2015), which all ensure lasting peace that will enable the State to recover its exclusive authority, constitutional institutions and republican system. We also declare our full respect for international humanitarian law, international human rights law and the various conventions and treaties adopted and ratified by the Republic of Yemen. We are working closely with the neighbouring countries and establishing constructive partnerships with the United Nations and the international community to ensure peace building and achieve security, stability, prosperity and freedom for all the peoples of the world. Our Presidential Leadership Council is committed to establishing an approach in line with the Charter and tasks of the United Nations, while facilitating the work of its humanitarian agencies, political missions and relevant oversight mechanisms to guarantee the political, economic and social rights of women and to bring an end to child exploitation and recruitment.
In our search for peace, we have endured painful experiences with the rebellious Houthi militias since the start of the Yemeni crisis. They have broken all their obligations and commitments, beginning with the peace and partnership agreement upon occupying the capital, Sana’a, in September 2014, followed by the first and second meetings in Geneva, the Kuwait consultations and the Stockholm Agreement, and finally the ongoing truce, during which the legitimate Government lost nearly 300 martyrs and more than 1,000 were injured due to the violations perpetrated by the terrorist militias.
In only one week, the humanitarian truce will end. The Presidential Leadership Council reminds the international community that the Government has respected all elements of the truce, namely, launching regular commercial flights to Sana’a airport and facilitating the entry of oil products to Al-Hudaydah ports in an attempt to alleviate the suffering of our people. The Houthi terrorist militias maintain their closure of roads to Ta’iz, which has been besieged for seven years, as well as roads to other provinces. They do not pay the wages of their employees or release prisoners, detainees and abductees. They resort to any excuse to violate the truce and obstruct United Nations and international efforts to extend it in order to achieve the comprehensive peace that we all seek. We want a lasting peace. The truce proved without a doubt that we lack a serious partner who wants peace.
The Yemenis are now convinced that it will be difficult to achieve sustained calm without strict deterrence against a sectarian armed group. In that context, we stress the steadfast position of the Yemeni Presidential Leadership Council welcoming the renewal of the truce. However, the renewal must not take place if it is not in the interest of the Yemeni people if it is used to prepare for another round of war or if it undermines our sovereignty. The renewal must not empower the terrorist militias, which threaten not only Yemen but the whole region and the entire world. For us, peace is a strategic choice. There is no doubt about that. We are perfectly aware of the difficulty of leading our country without the involvement of all Yemenis. However, we cannot allow any armed group to enjoy the monopoly of power and law enforcement. That is the foundation of a State that the Yemeni people deserve, like all other peoples of the world.
For the terrorist militias, the main issue of establishing peace is related not to their concern for sovereignty, as they claim, but to ensure a place above the State and above the people for their leaders, who claim that they have a divine mandate to govern the people. They export transboundary violence and adopt a hostile approach against peace and coexistence while calling for hatred, infidelity and hostility. I am aware that it is difficult for other States that have long lived in peace and stability to understand that there are human beings who claim to have a divine mandate to rule other human beings in this era. They believe that peace constitutes a mental invasion and a soft war. However, that is one of the common realities among the Houthi terrorist militias, Al-Qaida, Da’esh, Boko Haram and other terrorist organizations throughout the world.
The theme of this year’s session of the General Assembly — “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges” — first requires establishing clear values for peacebuilding under a stable Government and a strict deterrence to protect the political process and pave its way by all means. However, if we continue to fear that the use of force will undermine attempts to strengthen a precarious calm and that designating that group as terrorists will lead to a humanitarian disaster, then we must look for equally
deterrent alternatives. There is nothing better than the international community’s support for the legitimate Government to ensure that the values of freedom, peace and coexistence prevail. From an academic point of view, diplomacy is based on bringing different points of view closer. We can only implement diplomacy as such in the context of a legitimate regime. Entities that deny the rules of the international system must not be communicated with; otherwise, the principles and the Charter of the Organization will be violated.
While the world is not paying enough attention to the suffering of the Yemeni people and their voices calling for freedom and good living and is focused on other hotspots of tension across the world, we have had good brothers on our side and an alliance to support legitimacy, led by the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have sacrificed blood and money and taken responsibility for defending a State Member of the United Nations on behalf of the international community. They have also hosted millions of Yemeni refugees, who have been accorded many benefits in those countries, including work, residency, medical care and education. This year, the Presidential Leadership Council and the Government of political competencies have received support in various fields from our brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. We also cannot forget to commend the funding, humanitarian and development aid we have received from the United States of America, the European Union and the United Kingdom, in addition to other sincere friends as a support for our just cause.
Nevertheless, we are experiencing a wider gap in funding that threatens to close more relief programmes intended to save lives, including in the areas of food and health care. In addition to the need of rapid response from humanitarian organizations, it is also more important to invest in long-term income-generating projects and to channel all funds through the Central Bank in Aden in order to support the national currency and lower prices of basic goods so as to avoid a potential famine.
The obstacles imposed by the terrorist militias should not prevent us from shouldering our ethical responsibilities to avoid the imminent spill in the Red Sea of more than 1 million barrels of crude oil contained in the FSO SAFER oil tank for the past five years, which could lead to a destructive environmental disaster that would exceed fourfold the Exxon Valdez oil spill in the Pacific Ocean in 1989. On this occasion, we thank all countries and Yemeni businessmen who contributed to the plan of salvaging the FSO SAFER, which the Houthi terrorist militias are using as leverage to exert pressure and make money.
We join all countries in seeking to ensure free navigation in international waters and in fighting extremism, terrorism and piracy. We also call for efforts to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in particular Iran’s nuclear programme, ballistic missiles and destructive role in the region. We also call on the international community to condemn Iran’s blatant interference in our country’s security and stability. Iran is transforming it to a cross-border platform for threatening activity. Iran must be subjected to sanctions under the resolutions of international legitimacy relevant to the Yemeni dossier. In that context, we call on Member States to commit themselves to the disarmament regime, while confronting Iran’s destabilizing influence in the region and preventing it from providing its militias with military technologies, such as ballistic missiles and drones, that are used to perpetrate acts of terrorism against civilians in our country and countries of the region, including planting millions of internationally banned mines on land and in the sea. Iran also targets international maritime routes, in stark violation of international law.
The Republic of Yemen stresses its steadfast position concerning the Palestinian question and achieving peace and a just and comprehensive solution to that question based on the resolutions of international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative in order to ensure the establishment of an independent State for the Palestinian people.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights enshrines respect for the inherent dignity of each human being with equal rights that constitute the bases of freedom, justice and peace in the world. That is why we always need to prioritize those rights in all tasks of the General Assembly on behalf of tens of thousands of our citizens who are refugees, detainees, kidnapped, disappeared or jailed, including journalists, activists, artists, relief workers and hostages of all ages. Members do not need more evidence to prove the stark violations committed in areas under the control of Houthi terrorist militias as the worst places for public freedom and human rights in the world.
I would like to conclude by telling a story. A Yemeni who survived the militias, when asked recently by a medical doctor in Cairo about his date of birth,
answered that he was born two weeks ago, meaning since he left Sana’a and survived the militias. However, he was extremely concerned about his family and friends whom he had left behind. That is why we must delay no further in our collective mission of returning millions of Yemeni people to life, hope and the future that members wish for their dear and dignified populations."
Zambia,ZMB,Africa,"  17,352,000 ",3538,7.791999817,4.0,63.51,HIV/AIDS,Cardiovascular Disease,Neonatal Disorder,1303,7.51,"  7,725,887 ",44.52,5.04,"At the outset, we would like to congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session. With his vast experience, we are confident that he will successfully provide the leadership required during his tenure as President of the General Assembly. We pay tribute, of course, in the same manner to Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for his unwavering dedication and excellent stewardship of the Assembly at its seventy- sixth session.
We are meeting here at a very difficult time when global challenges have not only multiplied but have become more complex. Those challenges include the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic; climate change; the war in Ukraine and its associated effects on and disruptions to supply chains; food insecurity around the world; and high commodity and energy prices, as well as the overall high cost of living. They have cast a dark shadow over the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on our continent and around the world. The risk of reversal in our hard-won development gains is very real. COVID-19 unmasked global inequalities that stretch well beyond income and political boundaries, as the variations in access to vaccines have shown. The risks of further inequality are also real, especially for our developing countries, whose capacity to adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change is inadequate, sadly, in spite of our insignificant carbon footprint. This is truly a defining moment of our time in which we must channel our collective efforts to address the numerous challenges that we face.
That is why Zambia welcomes the challenge to build on Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) and endorses the call to convene a summit of the future. We call for arriving at a pact for the future that underwrites a new form of multilateralism in our world — one where major challenges are faced together, in solidarity, within the context of a revitalized international order that is rules-based, fair and inclusive, with the United Nations at the centre of it all. As a country two thirds of whose population is below the age of 25, the outlook for the future and an emphasis on intergenerational equity are very important to us. Our Government seeks to harness that demographic dividend by investing in its youthful and energetic population for a better future. We therefore support the establishment of the United Nations Youth Office. That should encourage the meaningful engagement of young people in diverse ways, such as in political representation, access to lifelong skills training and education, support for youth innovation and entrepreneurship and indeed in decision-making in all areas of life, including climate change and environmental protection.
In spite of the steady progress that has been made in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic, we still need to remain vigilant to guard against the possibility of its resurgence. We have all experienced the negative impact of the pandemic, particularly with the loss of millions of our loved ones and disruptions to socioeconomic activities across the world. As the world continues to recover from the pandemic, it is therefore essential to find lasting solutions, including by investing in resilient health systems that will respond to future pandemics such as COVID-19, among others. That means establishing a versatile international public health regime that will shun the hoarding of vaccines
and related technologies in order to guarantee the rapid deployment of supplies from a global reserve for tackling future pandemics.
The re-emergence of polio in our world is of great concern. For that reason, together with a number of countries in our region, Zambia is participating in supplementary immunization activities in order to prevent and halt the spread of the wild poliovirus type 1. That is in addition to ongoing activities to fight other vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, as well as to strengthen our routine immunization and maintain essential maternal and child health services. As the Global Cholera Control Champion — with many thanks to the World Health Organization, which gave us the opportunity to serve in that role — we must continue our fight against cholera with vigour. We also need to remain alert to any possible outbreaks of monkeypox, the Ebola virus or other such threats. The international community must also work together to address the growing threat to environmental, human and animal health resulting from antimicrobial resistance, commonly referred to as drug resistance. Drug- resistant bacterial infections continue to cause millions of deaths. Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, bears the greatest burden of resistant bacterial infections, which account for a large proportion of deaths in our regions. That calls for better control systems when it comes to access to antimicrobial medicines for both human and animal use. I shall now focus on other areas of interest.
With regard to economic performance, the crisis in Ukraine has hampered the recovery that was slowly taking hold, particularly in the developing world, where large sections of society remain in extreme poverty and inequalities widen by the day. Countries that have seen their attainment of the SDGs go off-track must intensify their national consultative processes and stakeholder engagements and renew their commitments to reducing poverty, tackling energy poverty, supporting debt restructuring and enhancing access to concessional financing, which is very important for our own national development agendas.
For our part, we hereby indicate in that regard our intention to present our second voluntary national review in July 2023 to highlight Zambia’s progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Despite the challenging external environment, our resolve to rebuild the Zambian economy is stronger than ever before. Our economic recovery is on track, as evidenced by positive growth indicators and the stabilization of key macroeconomic variables such as interest rates, exchange rates, market stability and inflation, which we have been able to bring down from 25 per cent to 9.8 per cent in just one year in office. Zambia is on a path of growth from the economic contraction we experienced in the past, which was somewhere in the region of minus 2 per cent, to a gross domestic product now estimated to grow at approximately 3 per cent. That means we have seen economic growth of approximately 5 per cent in the past 12 months, which was difficult to achieve but was possible with a lot of hard work. Nevertheless, we still want to do more.
In terms of social economic benefits, our commitment to providing equal opportunities, especially for young people, has been demonstrated by the introduction of free primary and secondary education, as we believe that without a doubt, education is the best equalizer, the best investment and the best inheritance. Consistent with our pledge to invest in human capital, we have recruited more than 30,000 teachers and 11,000 health workers in 2022 alone. We are decentralizing service delivery and have increased the allocation of our constituency development fund by more than 1,000 per cent in our first budget in office. That is just the beginning. The expenditure of those funds at the community level is meant to ensure inclusive and sustainable economic growth that will support the development of small- and medium-sized enterprises and employment creation across all of our 10 provinces and 156 constituencies.
I am pleased to note that in principle we have reached an agreement with our creditors under the Common Framework for Debt Treatments to restructure the national debt we inherited. We have also effectively concluded a deal with the International Monetary Fund based on our important home-grown economic transformation plan. We are very grateful to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the United Nations system as a whole and other cooperating partners for their support.
The adverse effects of climate change have continued to ravage our planet. In addressing the emerging global climate crisis, I would like to point to a recent situation in Zambia, where in a single season one half of the country experienced total crop failure due to extreme drought while the other half experienced floods. That is obviously not normal. Those are the negative effects of climate change. Such extreme weather events are a
timely reminder of the grave consequences of climate change. Without a doubt, we need robust solutions and cohesion in our approach at the global and regional levels to address the effects of climate change. As Chair of the African Group of Negotiators on Climate Change, Zambia calls for enhanced global efforts to address the issue, which should include increased financial support for countries with limited resources to mitigate and adapt to the negative effects of climate change. Zambia has mainstreamed green growth and climate-change proofing in its current national development plan, which has articulated broad policy measures for transitioning Zambia into a climate-resilient and inclusive green economy over time.
Thirdly, Zambia has continued to build on efforts to attain gender equality and inclusivity in various sectors of our society. Based on empirical evidence, the empowerment of women and poverty alleviation are positively correlated. It is therefore imperative that we dedicate corresponding efforts to ensuring that gender disparities are curtailed at all levels. Under its national gender policy, Zambia has been implementing affirmative action in favour of women and girls to ensure that their full potential is realized at all times. To complement those measures, Zambia is championing the campaign to end child marriage in Africa, and of course all over the world. In the same vein, we are proud to inform the Assembly that earlier today, Zambia, Canada and other cooperating partners held a side event to galvanize support and review the commitment of the international community to ending child, early and forced marriage. With the assurances made during that event, we are hopeful that we will be able to achieve target 5.3 of Sustainable Development Goal 5, on gender equality, in our programming, which aims to eliminate that harmful practice.
The world at large has grappled with growing instability and insecurity over the past year and the effects have been felt by millions of people around the world as lives and livelihoods have been lost everywhere. Zambia believes that without peace and stability, our joint development efforts will be in vain — I repeat, totally in vain. We are therefore committed to remaining strong advocates of peace and stability in Southern Africa, on the entire African continent and the world over. Our guiding principle is that instability anywhere is instability everywhere. That reminds us that ending war and conflict is not only the responsibility of those directly involved in the conflict but also a shared obligation of every global citizen and every nation. I mean all of us, without exception. We cannot afford to allow instability to derail our noble programmes to better the lives of our people. We therefore take this matter seriously and will continue to actively participate in efforts to restore peace in all the troubled regions of our global village. As the incoming Chair of the Southern African Development Community organ for politics, defence and security cooperation, Zambia will prioritize the restoration of peace and stability in our own country, to start with, and in the region. As the saying goes, charity begins at home.
At the continental level, Zambia remains engaged and committed to the efforts of the African Union and the United Nations to promote peace in various conflict areas around the world. Going forward, I would argue that our United Nations system should tilt more efforts towards the prevention of conflicts, which is more cost-effective and palatable. As a signatory to various disarmament treaties and conventions, Zambia remains committed to promoting global peace and security.
Zambia joins other Governments in expressing particular concern about the ongoing war in Ukraine. As we stand with all who are affected, in both Ukraine and its neighbours, we also want to take this opportunity to stress the far-reaching negative consequences of the war, particularly for the price of food, fuel, fertilizer and other key commodities across the world. In any part of the world, war has a damaging effect on economic activity, which derails our collective fight against poverty and hunger. A few months of war can erase decades of progress, and I want to emphasize that. We must take note of it. We therefore categorically condemn war anywhere and continue to urge all the parties involved to pursue diplomatic solutions for conflict resolution. I would like to emphasize that our United Nations should continue its peace efforts in this particular conflict. The efforts of the President and all of us collectively are well recognized. I am grateful for that.
We would like to stress that global ambitions for peace and security largely depend on the effectiveness of the Security Council. However, the inadequacies of the Council’s current structure have become increasingly pronounced, with the ceding to the General Assembly of decision-making on matters of global peace and security that would otherwise have been the preserve of the Security Council and that should be the preserve
of the Security Council. However, the burden has now been pushed onto the General Assembly. That is not right, and it brings to the fore the need for long- overdue reform of the Council. We appreciate the call from President Biden for greater inclusivity in the Security Council. We therefore continue to advance the African Common Position, as espoused in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, to ensure the effectiveness, credibility and legitimacy of our Security Council.
In conclusion, we would like to reaffirm Zambia’s commitment to the fundamental principles on which the United Nations was founded and that safeguard our shared future of peace and prosperity for all nations, not just for some. I shall emphasize that point — the principles that safeguard our shared future of peace, stability and prosperity for all nations.

Allow me to congratulate Mr. Csaba Korosi on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy- seventh session. He can be assured of Zimbabwe’s full support as his guides our deliberations during the current session.
I also pay special tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Abdulla Shahid, for leading the seventy-sixth session of the General Assembly as the world grappled with a plethora of challenges. We commend him for the President of the General Assembly Fellowship for Harnessing Opportunities for Promoting Empowerment of Youth initiative towards enhancing youth interest, engagement and commitment in the work of the United Nations. That will go a long way towards safeguarding the interests of future generations, as embodied in today’s youth. Their voices must be heard across our Governments and within the United Nations. Zimbabwe is privileged to be among the pioneering beneficiaries of the initiative.
Delivering the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development remains an urgent priority for us all. Our theme for this session, “A watershed moment: transformative solutions to interlocking challenges”, captures the importance of scaling up our actions, informed by the state of our world. The number of
persons exposed to food insecurity continues to increase. Meanwhile, the scourges of conflict and climate change have become major drivers of migration and refugees. The ever-looming threat associated with the “triple C crisis” of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), conflict and climate change has placed upon us an enormous responsibility to confront these interlocking challenges by strengthening multilateralism and solidarity. Terrorism, biodiversity loss, desertification, pollution and cybercrime, among other challenges, reinforce the urgent need to implement inclusive and transformative solutions that leave no one and no place behind.
The seventy-seventh session comes in the wake of the debilitating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which overstretched our health-care systems and severely exposed the disparities between developed and developing countries with regard to vaccine access. Africa is among the most affected. The lessons from the pandemic should inspire and enable the General Assembly to urgently scale up means to build multi-pronged capacities that must guide our collective response to future pandemics and other global challenges.
Despite the illegal economic sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe has successfully implemented its COVID-19 National Response Strategy, anchored largely by our own internal resources and institutional capacities. The proactive approach of my Administration has enabled the country to achieve high vaccination rates, extending to children up to 12 years. Meanwhile, our focus on the construction, rehabilitation and modernization of health facilities across the country, coupled with enhanced capacities around biotechnology and the pharmaceutical value chain, attests to my Government’s determination to realize universal health coverage.
Lifting many more people out of poverty and into a higher quality of life must remain at the core of both United Nations activities and the programmes and projects of our respective countries. Zimbabwe has made significant strides towards ending poverty and hunger. That has seen the implementation of various policies and programmes to support and empower communal and small-scale farmers.
At the household level, the provision of agriculture inputs, equipment and technical support to farmers, especially the vulnerable, has contributed to household and national food and nutrition security. However, in 2022, mid-season drought and tropical cyclones regrettably reduced the overall performance of the agriculture sector. To that end, the climate change conundrum has continued to be an albatross. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change should remain the primary platforms for negotiating our collective global response to climate change. All measures taken to achieve the targets and commitments set under the Paris Agreement have to be implemented. Furthermore, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities in the light of different national circumstances must also be reflected.
Financing for climate change has remained inadequate, leaving the scope for effective and just transition to renewable energy among developing countries under serious threat. It is our hope that at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Egypt later this year, the developed countries will deliver more concrete action on climate change, not just for mitigation targets, but also in relation to adaptation, loss and damage, climate-specific finance, technology transfer and capacity-building.
In our case, Zimbabwe is making concerted and deliberate efforts to integrate climate action into our national policies, strategies and planning. That includes strengthening the resilience and adaptive capacity of the most vulnerable in our society. Additionally, my Government is implementing an ambitious programme to increase the number of dams for irrigation. The programme is expected to create greenbelts across the country as we reduce dependence on rain-fed agricultural activities while enhancing export-led production and productivity.
Our comprehensive Agriculture and Food Systems Transformation Strategy is focused on increasing production and productivity across the agriculture spectrum. That was instrumental in our unprecedented realization of national wheat self-sufficiency, as well as increased exports in horticulture. The provision of technical extension services for improved land and water use has seen the widespread adoption of climate-smart agricultural innovations, with evident upward increase of incomes among communal and smallholder farmers, as well as women and youth in agriculture.
Zimbabwe is committed to 2030 Agenda and has, to that end, mainstreamed the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into our national economic development blueprint, the National Development Strategy. We
acknowledge the support of the United Nations in the alignment of the Strategy with the Sustainable Development Goals. Economic reforms have been implemented, resulting in significant progress in sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, mining and tourism. Our “Zimbabwe is open for business” mantra has fostered strong partnership between the Government and the private sector for inclusive and sustainable development. Massive infrastructure development projects, which include dams, energy plants and roads, have broadened our national economic asset base, as well as production and productivity enablers, while enhancing regional connectivity and integration.
The current global financial architecture has demonstrated its inadequacies in addressing the challenges that confront us. An increasing and unsustainable debt burden, the prohibitive cost of borrowing, illicit financial flows and the exploitation of natural resources from developing countries have all combined to relegate developing countries to the periphery of the global financial system. There is therefore a need for a global financial system that is just, more inclusive and responsive to the challenges we face. Equally, the international trade architecture under the World Trade Organization has remained largely exclusive and indifferent to the needs of developing countries. The African Continental Free Trade Area is thus expected to be the panacea for Africa in trading and stimulating economic growth and development. The Free Trade Area must be complemented as we strive to improve production and trade in goods and services. The liberalization of services and strengthening of competition policy and intellectual property rights, as well as the adoption of digital trade, should also be enhanced.
Education is a key driver of sustainable development with a direct impact on SDG 4, on quality education; SDG 5, on gender equality; and SDG 17, on partnerships for the goals. Zimbabwe has embarked on reforms based on our Heritage Based Education 5.0 model, which emphasizes science, technology, innovation and industrialization. Those are indeed necessary tools to leap forward the modernization and industrialization of our countries in the developing world. My Government is equally providing quality, inclusive and accessible education through the roll-out of a phased, free primary school education system. The Transforming Education Summit during this high-level week is a timely and welcome development that should help revitalize the education sector, even more so after COVID-19-induced disruptions.
My country notes that more work needs to be done globally to close the gender gaps that are often aggravated in times of crisis. Opportunities are being created for all Zimbabweans, especially for women and youth, to realize their individual and collective potential. Milestones have thus been achieved in the implementation of SDG 5 on gender equality, leading to expanded empowerment and employment opportunities for women and young people.
The proportional representation for women in Parliament is enshrined in the Constitution. Under my leadership, Zimbabwe has legislated reserved youth seats in the National Assembly. To further strengthen participatory democracy and good governance, my Government has introduced a 30-per cent quota for women in local authorities. That is especially important as women bear the brunt of poor service delivery at the local level. The establishment of gender and youth focal desks within Government ministries has helped to mainstream the issues of young people, particularly young women.
Sustainable socioeconomic development is an indispensable imperative for the enjoyment of the fundamental rights of any people. The Policy on Devolution and Decentralization has seen increased budgetary support directly to local authorities. Communities at the village, ward and district levels are now making independent decisions and prioritizing their programmes and projects, informed by the most pressing needs at their level. That has seen the rapid construction of schools, clinics, water and sanitation infrastructure, and other social amenities in the most remote areas of Zimbabwe.
In the same vein, my Government is promoting heritage-based rural industrialization to guarantee improved livelihoods and incomes for all communities, based on their respective, unique natural resource endowments. Zimbabwe is modernizing and industrializing based on our local resources and human capital base. Inspired by the historic monument, the Great Zimbabwe, from which our country’s name is derived, we are building our country brick by brick, stone upon stone, with the support of our friends and partners. As my Government continues to entrench democracy, good governance and the rule of law, we are committed to vibrant, competitive and peaceful political contestations.
Notwithstanding our success, the ongoing deleterious effects of the illegal sanctions continue to hamper and slow our progress and the realization of sustainable and inclusive development. Zimbabwe is a peace-loving country. We remain indebted to the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region and the African Union, as well as other progressive members of the comity of nations for their unwavering support and calls for the removal of these unwarranted and unjustified sanctions. We once again call for their immediate and unconditional removal. My country welcomes the findings of the Special Rapporteur on the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights, who visited Zimbabwe in 2021.
At the international level, Zimbabwe has adopted an engagement and re-engagement policy. The policy is underpinned by the principles of mutual understanding and respect, cooperation, partnership and shared values with other members of the international community. We desire to be a friend to all and an enemy to none. My country is greatly concerned that more than 20 years after the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, hate crimes, xenophobia, racial discrimination and intolerance have continued to increase at an alarming rate, including at the international level. There is a need, therefore, to recommit to fighting those scourges in all their forms and manifestations.
The spread of terrorism and the intensification of old conflicts on the African continent and throughout the world have been a setback to our quest to silence the guns. In southern Africa, we remain seized with insecurity and terrorist insurgency in northern parts of Cabo Delgado in Mozambique and conflicts in parts of the Great Lakes region. Emboldened by our SADC regional philosophy that an injury to one is an injury to all, we continue to pool our resources to fight terrorism and other threats to peace, security and stability in our region. We appeal to the United Nations to render the requisite support to our efforts to restore peace in the affected areas.
Zimbabwe stands committed to playing its part for the realization of peace and security within various United Nations, African Union and SADC peacekeeping and peacebuilding missions. The scale and gravity of our challenges today cannot be addressed through old structures and old ways of doing business. Zimbabwe subscribes to the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration as the sustainable approach to the reform of the Security Council.
In conclusion, Zimbabwe reaffirms its commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter and multilateralism in the resolution of the complex and intersecting challenges facing our world. The implementation of the inclusive 2030 Agenda remains our biggest hope for the future we all want. There is indeed a more compelling case for enhanced solidarity, cooperation and partnerships if we are to respond effectively to these challenges and ensure our collective survival. The United Nations should remain the beacon and source of hope for the global citizenry. As leaders, we have a weighty burden and responsibility to make the United Nations deliver to the expectations of all the peoples of the world."
